<b>Principal's Address</b> <br>
 First and foremost, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the previous Principal, Mrs Jennifer Pang, for her stewardship of the school. She will be missed by staff, students and parents. Much of the good work during her time here will continue and be built upon in years to come. 

  

Year 2023 will be the first full year that we will begin to experience an almost pre-Covid scenario in terms of the activities and learning experiences in school. Many students are looking forward to this and I feel very excited for them. Being able to interact freely and seeing emotions of happiness or sadness (without the mask) are important for social and emotional development. In Corporation Primary School, I sense a strong culture of care amongst students and staff. This is the school’s strength. In the years to come, we will also uncover many more strengths that reside in our students and staff that will make the school a vibrant place for everyone. This will be in line with the school’s mission of developing talents in our students. 

  

The school will also strive to provide varied learning experiences that are holistic and more importantly teach skills beyond just academic application but also one that prepares our students for lifelong learning. Learning experiences that foster curiosity and a growth mindset are essential in promoting the love for learning. This could potentially be transformative if we can infuse the learning with students’ passion and interest so they can find even deeper meaning in learning. 

  

To do all this, the school will also need the support of our stakeholders like parents and community partners, to have this collective belief for us to bring out the best in every child. Let us be involved in this together be it in school, at home or in the community. Every child is a blessing for a better future.
