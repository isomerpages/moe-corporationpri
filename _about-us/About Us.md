About Us
========

It is a great honour to be posted to Corporation Primary School (CPS) as the 7th Principal of the school – a school that believes in holistic education of the students. In 2015, CPS celebrated its 40th Anniversary and I was at the concert, commemorating the event with the staff and students of the school. I was very impressed with the energy and enthusiasm of the little actors and actresses who exude an immense amount of pride for the school as they performed on stage. The staff too, was hard at work getting the students ready for their big show, ensuring every small little detail was taken care of to make everyone at the concert comfortable. Overall, it was a positive experience where everyone is proud to be part of the CPS family.  

  

In CPS, we believe very strongly in creating possibilities in our students. We help them to discover their talents and develop their interests and strengths. Personally, I believe that every child can learn and given the right environment and support, the child will Grow and Glow. CPS is blessed to have very committed and capable team of teachers and non-teaching staff who believe in developing every child, not only academically, but also in values and character. Schools are part of the society. Therefore, partnership with parents and the community is important to help nurture our students to Grow and Glow. Together, we will provide our students with a unique learning experience that nurtures each and every one of them to be individuals of good character, anchored in sound moral values, equipped with the 21st Century Competencies and knowledge for higher learning.

  

Quoting Mahatma Gandhi,

  

_Your beliefs become your thoughts,_

_Your thoughts become your words,_

_Your words become your actions,_

_Your actions become your habits,_

_Your habits become your values,_

_Your values become your destiny._

  

Our school vision, Nurturing Pupils who **C.A.R.E** to succeed (C- Confident, A- Actively Contribute, R- Resilient, E- Enthusiastically Learn), hinges on our school belief that every child is well-anchored in the right values and skills. I am confident that the parents will work with us closely to inculcate these values in our students.

  

I am thankful to the previous principals for laying a strong foundation in the school, allowing me the opportunity to delve deeper into the curriculum and develop depth in the teaching and learning processes. Moving forward, the school hopes to create new platforms for our students to care, share, learn and motivate one another to greater heights.
