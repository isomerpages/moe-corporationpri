**Policy On The Use Of The Internet**
-------------------------------------

Corporation Primary School is well equipped with computers in the computer laboratories. Computers are used as a tool in teaching and learning with the aim to facilitate learning through the use of information technology.

The Internet is an extremely rich resource both for learning and for recreation. We encourage pupils to make effective use of the rich information and resources available on the Internet both for study and for recreation. We also encourage pupils to develop the appropriate skills and understanding that will enable them to use these resources well and safely, as well as the ability to analyse and evaluate the resources they find. These skills will be fundamental in the society our pupils will be entering. Pupils are encouraged to make use of both the world wide web and email.

To prevent children having access to any materials on the Internet which may be illegal, defamatory, inaccurate, obscene or offensive, the school’s internet access will only be permitted whilst they are supervised by the teachers or IT trainers.

The school has built and maintained a site on the world wide web. Pupils whose work or images appear on the school’s website will be identified only by the first names. Should any parent or guardian particularly wish their child’s name or photograph not to appear on the school’s website, their wish will be respected.

Children using the school’s computing facilities will be expected to comply with the following rules. Failure to abide by the rules may result in a temporary or permanent ban on the pupil’s use of the facilities.

  

*   I will only use the Internet when I am being supervised by a teacher / IT trainer.
    
*   I will not email or display offensive messages or pictures.
    
*   I will not send emails or make entries on social networks using obscene language.
    
*   I will not send emails or make entries on social networks which annoy, insult or attack other people.
    
*   I will not do anything that might cause damage to computers or data stored on computers.
    
*   I will respect the copyright of other people’s work and will not copy or download anything that belongs to someone else without their permission.
    
*   I will respect other people’s work and not use people’s passwords or interfere with their work or files.
    
*   I will not deliberately waste limited resources.
