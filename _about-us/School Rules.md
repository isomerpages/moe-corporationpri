**Morning Reporting Time**
-------------------------------------

Morning activities are planned for pupils from 7.30 am to 7.45 am. They include fitness activities, prize-giving, presentations, briefings, and attire checks, to name a few. As such, pupils are expected to be at the assembly venue from 7.30 am every morning.

Should a pupil need to eat his / her breakfast in school, they may do so before 7.25 am. If a pupil reaches school after 7.25 am (Mon – Thu), they may still buy their breakfast from the School Canteen to be packed and consumed during Snack Time, and should promptly make their way to the assembly venue after buying their food.

All pupils are required to be present when the National Anthem is sung and the National Pledge is taken. As such, pupils will not be allowed to buy food from 7.40 am (Mon – Thu) or 7.25 am (Fri). All pupils should also be in school no later than 7.40 am (Mon – Thu) or 7.25 am (Fri) in order to reach the assembly venue by 7.45 am (Mon – Thu) or 7.30 am (Fri).

Parents should remind their children about the importance of punctuality, and assist in planning his / her travel time to take into consideration possible delays such as traffic jams. Pupils will receive warning letters if they are persistently late after several reminders are given.

**Illness and Absence from School**
-------------------------------------

Pupils must attend school regularly and punctually so as not to miss any lesson and be at a disadvantage. However, if a pupil is ill or has a flu / fever / contagious or infectious disease, please inform the form teachers and do not send him / her to school. Any absence from school must be covered by a doctor’s medical certificate (MC) or letter* from the parent / guardian. Parents may submit MCs and letters either in hardcopy or through sending a message / photo.  When a pupil falls ill while in school, only the parent / guardian will be allowed to take him / her home.

On the day of a pupil’s absence, the form teacher will contact the parent to check on the pupil. If a pupil is absent frequently, the form teacher or other school personnel may conduct a home visit. Should there be no improvement in the pupil’s attendance, his / her parents will be requested to meet the principal for a discussion.

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;"><font size="-1">*The number of letters accepted will be limited to 5 per semester, and each letter should cover no more than a maximum of 3 days. If a pupil exceeds the accepted number of letters per semester, subsequent absences will be taken as invalid absences, which will affect his / her conduct grade.</font></p>

**Policy On The Use Of The Internet**
-------------------------------------
Corporation Primary School is well equipped with devices such as computers and iPads in the computer laboratories. Devices are used as a tool in teaching and learning with the aim to facilitate learning through the use of information technology.

The Internet is an extremely rich resource both for learning and for interaction. We encourage pupils to make effective use of the rich information and resources available on the Internet both for study and for interaction. We also encourage pupils to develop the appropriate skills and understanding that will enable them to use these resources well and safely, as well as the ability to analyse and evaluate the resources they find. These new media literacy skills will be fundamental in the society our pupils will be entering. 

Children using the school’s computing facilities will be expected to comply with the following rules. Failure to abide by the rules may result in a temporary or permanent ban on the pupil’s use of the facilities.
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;">•	I will not play games during lessons unless instructed otherwise by my teacher for teaching and learning purposes.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;">•	I will not surf the Internet without guidance from my teacher during lessons.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;">•	I will not share my personal information (e.g. address, phone number, pictures) with anyone online.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;">•	I will obey the terms of use of social media platforms use (e.g. age restrictions) and I will not have accounts on any social media platforms.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px;">•	I will not download, copy or share videos, music, pictures or other people’s work without permission.</p>

The school has built and maintained this website on the world wide web. Pupils whose work or images appear on the school’s website will be identified only by their first names.
