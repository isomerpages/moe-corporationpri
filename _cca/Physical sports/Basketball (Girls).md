<p>"Playing basketball and being part of the basketball CCA has been an amazing
journey for me. It has kept me active and healthy and also taught me the
importance of teamwork, dedication, resilience and sportsmanship. Through
hard work and determination, I have seen myself grow both as an individual
and as a player.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are truly fortunate to have amazing teachers guiding us on our basketball
journey. It is not just a sport, it is a journey filled with lessons, friendships
and memories that I will cherish for a lifetime."

<p>"Playing basketball and having been in the basketball school team has
been an incredible journey of growth and self-discovery. Starting out as
a novice, I was drawn to the sports by its fast-paced nature and the camaraderie
it fosters among teammates. Some of my most cherished memories include
the hard-fought victories, the unwavering support of my teammates and singing
songs with my friends in the bus when we won a game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basketball has taught me valuable life lessons such as the importance
of endurance, resilience, responsibility and cooperation. Basketball might
seem hard but it is really fun and enjoyable, I hope you will join basketball
girls! I promise you will enjoy it too!"</p>
