<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Volleyball has been in CPS since 2012. It is a team sport in which two
teams of six players are separated by a high net. It requires cooperation
and communication among players. Through their active participation, our
boys learnt how to synergize together towards a common goal, develop empathy
for each other and understand the importance of teamwork.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the last 12 years, our boys have had tremendous opportunities to
interact with one another in a positive and supportive environment. They
have been learning how to communicate effectively during training sessions
and continue to hone their volleyball skills through constructive feedback
from each other as they grow stronger as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Volleyball encourages our boys to be strategic and quick-thinking as they
have to think quickly on their feet in the court to win points from their
opponents. They learnt to analyze situations and adapt their gameplay throughout
their matches. Volleyball brings joy and fulfilment to our boys as they
reflect from their mistakes and embrace a growth mindset to bounce forward
stronger as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a team, the teachers and coach believe in the strength of every player
as each of them contribute positively to the holistic growth of the volleyball
team in CPS. Our alumni volleyball boys lent their support from time to
time as they reminisce their foundation years in volleyball from Corporation
Primary School. Onward, CPS Volleyball boys as we grow and nurture together
as a team!</p>

<p>"Being part of the Volleyball CCA has taught me many things throughout
my years in Volleyball. Teamwork is the most important value in the game.
I have learnt to be a better leader through guiding and learning from my
teammates.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the guidance of the coaches and teachers who believed
in us when we had doubts. The dedication and passion for the sports inspired
us to push beyond our limits and instilled values that extend far beyond
the court."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saw Wilmer from Responsibility 1 (2023)</p>
<p></p>
<p>"When I started out my CCA, I was disappointed initially as I did not
get into my chosen CCA. It did not take long for me to realize that volleyball
was indeed the best CCA for me as I have learnt so many life values from
it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2022, we emerged second in the Junior division as our senior team guided
us well and taught us many important tips to score against our opponents.
I am thankful that we had experienced seniors who guided us and honed our
skills. As a back court player in the school team, I learnt that if the
front three players are unable to receive the ball, it will be my responsibility
to save the ball and send it back to the front three players to spike and
score a point. I have also learnt hard that losing a point is not the end
of the game as we can always come back and score more points.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having been in the school team for the last 3 years, our camaraderie has
grown stronger and we have learnt from our mistakes from previous matches
and we have learnt to overcome them in upcoming matches. After my P6 graduation,
I hope to help my juniors excel in volleyball. My aspiration for the future
school team is to bring the glory back to Corporation Primary in the next
few years."</p>
