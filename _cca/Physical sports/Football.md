<p>"Football CCA has taught me that it is important to be disciplined. Through
drills, I learned skills such as dribbling, passing, ball mastery, and
shooting. My favourite part of training is when we get to play matches
with friends. One memorable training session was when my team scored 4
goals!"</p>

<p>"I enjoy Football training because I get to learn new skills and apply
them in matches. I will always remember the day I got to represent the
school to play my first NSG game. Participating in NSG games has taught
me a lot about respecting my opponents."</p>
