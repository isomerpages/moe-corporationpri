<p>“Football CCA has taught me the importance of discipline. Through drills,
I have learned skills such as dribbling, passing, ball mastery, and shooting.
My favourite part of training is when we get to play matches with friends.
One memorable training session was when my team scored four goals!”</p>

<p>“I enjoy football training because I get to learn new skills and apply
them in matches. I will always remember the day I got to represent the
school and play my first NSG game. Participating in NSG games has taught
me a lot about respecting my opponents.”</p>
