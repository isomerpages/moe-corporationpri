<h1>CCA</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Co-curricular activities (CCA) form an integral part of the school's objective
to provide an all-round education for our pupils. As such, every pupil
from P3 onwards is required to participate in one CCA during his/her primary
school years. CCA has been built into the curriculum time to ensure that
all P3 to P6 pupils participate in one CCA.</p>
<p>Please take note that all CCA are conducted on&nbsp;<strong>Tuesdays from 2.45p.m to 4.45p.m.</strong>
