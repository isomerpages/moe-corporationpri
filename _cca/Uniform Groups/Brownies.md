<br>Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops
them in 5 areas:
<br>Personal &amp; Social Development – Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured
Me
<br>Home – Home Safety &amp; Duties
<br>Outdoor – Discovering Nature, A Green World
<br>Community – My Country, My Neighbourhood, Helper
<br>International – My Brownie Friend, My World
<br>
<br>Brownies enjoy working for interest and proficiency badges and awards
that will help them develop new skills. Some of our activities include
outdoor cooking, outdoor baking, sewing West Division Events and Pack Holiday
Camps! Through our engaging and meaningful activities, they build lasting
friendships, learn to care for others and develop essential values and
competencies which would equip them to thrive in a rapidly changing world.

<p>"Being in Brownies has taught me how to become a better person. I enjoy
the games we play during our CCA sessions because I get to have fun with
Brownies from other levels and work together. I have also learnt to care
for and raise awareness about the environment through activities such as
plogging. I really enjoy the Pack Holiday Camps during the school holidays,
as I get to experience what it's like to be independent.
<br>
<br>I also enjoy attending events such as World Thinking Day and Brownie Revel,
where we meet Brownies from other schools and participate in interesting
activities and competitions.
<br>What I enjoy most is collecting badges! There are many different badges,
such as Sewing and Entertainer badges. I have learned how to cook, sew,
and many other skills while working on the various badges.
<br>
<br>I really hope other girls will join Brownies so they can gain new experiences
and learn new skills."</p>

<p>"The Brownies is a CCA for girls to attain the basic skills needed to
become a woman. I have really enjoyed my experience as a Brownie, as I
got to make friends with my seniors as well as juniors. I enjoyed the outings
to other schools and the camps held at our school. One thing Brownies has
helped me with is becoming a leader — in school, at home, and even in my
own mind. Our Brownie Motto is Lend a Hand. If you have a heart to serve,
you should join the Brownies!"</p>
