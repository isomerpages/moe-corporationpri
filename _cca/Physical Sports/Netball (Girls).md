<p>Netball is a non-contact team sport for girls that develops players' speed,
ball-handling skills, and ability to think fast, adapt, and make crucial
decisions on the court. Through netball, players learn the importance of
teamwork, selflessness, sacrifice, and, most importantly, the courage to
persevere in the face of difficulties.</p>
