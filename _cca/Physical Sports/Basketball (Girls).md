<p>“Playing basketball and being part of the Basketball CCA has been an amazing
journey for me. It has kept me active and healthy and has also taught me
the importance of teamwork, dedication, resilience, and sportsmanship.
Through hard work and determination, I have seen myself grow both as an
individual and as a player. We are truly fortunate to have amazing teachers
guiding us in our basketball journey. It is not just a sport; it is a journey
filled with lessons, friendships, and memories that I will cherish for
a lifetime.”

<p>“Playing basketball and being part of the basketball school team has been
an incredible journey of growth and self-discovery. Starting out as novices,
we were drawn to the sport by its fast-paced nature and the camaraderie
it fosters among teammates. Some of our most cherished memories include
hard-fought victories, the unwavering support of our teammates, and singing
songs with our friends on the bus after winning a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basketball has taught us valuable life lessons such as the importance
of endurance, resilience, responsibility, and cooperation. Basketball might
seem hard, but it is fun and enjoyable. We hope you will join Basketball
Girls! We promise you will enjoy it too!”</p>
