<p>"Being part of the basketball CCA has been an incredible journey for me.
Not only did I improve my skills on the court, but I also gained lifelong
friends and learned the value of teamwork. The coaches are dedicated and
supportive, pushing us to be the best version of ourselves both on and
off the court."</p>

<p>"Being part of the basketball CCA has taught me valuable life lessons
beyond the game itself. It's taught me how to handle pressure, overcome
adversity, and work towards a common goal with my teammates. The sense
of achievement I feel after each game or training session is indescribable,
and I'm grateful for the opportunities this CCA has given me to grow and
develop as both an athlete and a person."</p>
