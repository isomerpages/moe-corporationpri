<p><strong>More about the CCA</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Volleyball has been part of CPS since 2012. It is a team sport in which
two teams of six players are separated by a high net. It requires cooperation
and communication among players. Through their active participation, our
boys learn how to synergize towards a common goal, develop empathy for
each other, and understand the importance of teamwork.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the last 12 years, our boys have had tremendous opportunities to
interact with one another in a positive and supportive environment. They
have been learning how to communicate effectively during training sessions
and continue to hone their volleyball skills through constructive feedback
from each other as they grow stronger as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Volleyball encourages our boys to be strategic and quick-thinking as they
must think quickly on their feet in the court to win points from their
opponents. They learn to analyse situations and adapt their gameplay throughout
their matches. Volleyball brings joy and fulfilment to our boys as they
reflect on their mistakes and embrace a growth mindset to bounce back stronger
as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a team, the teachers and coach believe in the strength of every player,
as each of them contributes positively to the holistic growth of the volleyball
team at CPS. Our alumni volleyball players lend their support from time
to time as they reminisce about their foundation years in volleyball at
Corporation Primary School. Onward, CPS volleyball boys, as we grow and
nurture together as a team!</p>

<p>“Being part of the Volleyball CCA has taught me many things throughout
my years in volleyball. Teamwork is the most important value in the game.
I have learned to be a better leader through guiding and learning from
my teammates. I am grateful for the guidance of the coaches and teachers
who believed in us when we had doubts. Their dedication and passion for
the sport inspired us to push beyond our limits and instilled values that
extend far beyond the court.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saw Wilmer from Responsibility 1 (2023)</p>
<p></p>
<p>“When I started my CCA, I was initially disappointed as I did not get
into my chosen CCA. It did not take long for me to realize that volleyball
was indeed the best CCA for me as I have learned so many life values from
it. In 2022, we emerged second in the Junior division as our senior team
guided us well and taught us many important tips to score against our opponents.
I am thankful that we had experienced seniors who guided us and honed our
skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a backcourt player on the school team, I have learned that if the front
three players are unable to receive the ball, it is my responsibility to
save the ball and send it back to the front three players to spike and
score a point. I have also learned that losing a point is not the end of
the game as we can always come back and score more points.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having been on the school team for the last three years, our camaraderie
has grown stronger.&nbsp; We have learned from our mistakes in previous
matches and we overcome them in upcoming matches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After my P6 graduation, I hope to help my juniors excel in volleyball.
My aspiration for the future school team is to bring glory back to Corporation
Primary in the next few years.”</p>
