<p><strong>More about the CCA</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Infocomm Club CCA is dedicated to igniting students' passion for learning
by introducing them to new IT skills and fostering computational thinking
from a young age. Through engaging activities, students will develop crucial
abilities such as block-based programming and media production.</p>
<p>Additionally, they will learn important values such as compassion and
resilience as they assist each other in debugging codes and resolving conflicts
during project creation. Guided by trainers and teachers, students will
collaboratively apply their newfound knowledge to participate in various
competitions and sharing events.</p>

<p>"This coding CCA program has helped me to be more capable in things I
used to have problems with. I can code my own game properly after learning
coding and I made my mom and dad proud of me. I would like to continue
learning coding!"</p>

<p>"I learnt to take photos from different angles and improve my photography
skills during different lessons. I also learnt to post essays. I would
like teachers to give us a chance to explore more on photography."</p>
