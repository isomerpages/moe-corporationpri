<p><strong>More about the CCA</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) CCA aims to instil game sportsmanship and inculcate
values such as perseverance as students play against their peers. During
practice sessions, students can hone life skills such as strategic planning
and critical thinking as they encounter novel situations. Students find
the practice sessions enriching as they can choose to play physical chess
matches or use iPads to play virtual matches.</p>
<p>We are committed to nurturing students and hope that they can apply these
values and skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.</p>

<p>"Xiangqi is fun! We look forward to Tuesdays as we can play friendly matches
with our friends. In fact, Tuesday is my favourite day of every school
week. The Xiangqi CCA has taught us about patience, critical thinking and
strategic planning as we face players of different background.</p>
<p>The CCA also provides us with opportunities to participate in competitions,
and we get to build friendship with students from other schools. What a
refreshing experience! We will certainly recommend this CCA to our classmates!"</p>

<p>"During the training sessions, we get to learn many basic techniques about
Xiangqi. Through the CCA, we have built friendships. We appreciated that
losing and winning are not the main focus of a game. It is the strengthening
of friendship that counts. We also feel excited as we get to play matches
with our subject teachers. During CCA, we get to use iPad to play virtual
matches and gain experience. Come join us!"</p>
