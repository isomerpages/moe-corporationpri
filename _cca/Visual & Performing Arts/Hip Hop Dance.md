<p>"I joined Hip Hop CCA because of my love for the music, having danced
to it since age four. Participating in various performances, including
the Racial Harmony Showcase with Malay and Chinese dancers, taught me endurance
and perseverance. Maintaining energy levels during training while fasting,
I learned self-care. Managing my schedule for school, dance, and rest with
support from teachers and parents helped me prioritize and stay disciplined."</p>

<p>“I joined the Dance CCA due to my fascination with Hip Hop performances.
In just two weeks, I mastered the Crab dance and went on to compete in
the Singapore Youth Festival. Through my involvement in the CCA, I have
improved my memory, teamwork, and collaboration skills. I also carefully
balance academics and dance, serving as a leader to guide and teach my
juniors while finding fulfilment in showcasing our hard work through performances.”</p>
