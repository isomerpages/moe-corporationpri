<p><strong>More about the CCA</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Chinese dance CCA aims to nurture our members into passionate dancers
and responsible leaders who learn to appreciate the Chinese culture through
the different forms of Chinese dance. Our Chinese dancers have put in many
hours of hard work and achieved outstanding results. They have also exemplified
the school values of endurance and responsibility. Our talented dancers
were invited to various external performances allowing them to gain precious
experiences.</p>

<p>“Chinese Dance is interesting and fun because we can learn and explore
the Chinese dance culture. We have learned that good things take time.
We learn to be patient because we need to use ample time to loosen our
muscles to become flexible and practise our dance steps consistently. I
like the team spirit in our dance CCA, we always work together and try
our best to synchronize our dance steps. We have learned to work together
as a team to give a good performance.”</p>

<p>“Chinese Dance is a good CCA because we have learned that we can deliver
a good dance performance when we work together. Personally, I have also
learned to be more responsible by practising dance moves consistently during
my own free time.”</p>
