<p>"Chinese Dance is interesting and fun because we can learn and explore
the Chinese Dance culture. In the Chinese Dance CCA, we learnt good things
take time. We learn to be patient because we know we need ample time to
loosen our muscles to become flexible, practice our dance steps agagin
and again to perform a good dance performance in order to achieve a good
result in SYF.</p>
<p>I like the team spirit in our dance CCA as we would always work together
and try our best to make sure our dance steps are synchronize. We learnt
to work together as a team to give a good performance."</p>
