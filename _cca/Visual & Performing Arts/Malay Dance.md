<p>The Malay dance team is well-known in Corporation Primary School and has
received numerous awards for the past Singapore Youth Festival competitions.
As member of the team, students are exposed to the various traditional&nbsp;dance&nbsp;themes
such as&nbsp;zapin, inang, joget, masri and&nbsp;asli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout their journey as a Malay dancer, students learn values such
as endurance, responsibility and humility as they learn the importance
of working together as a team during their performance</p>
