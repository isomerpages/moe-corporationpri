<p>The Malay dance team is well-known at Corporation Primary School and has
received awards in past Singapore Youth Festival competitions. As members
of the team, students are exposed to various traditional dance themes such
as zapin, inang, joget, masri, and asli. Throughout their journey as Malay
dancers, students learn values such as endurance, responsibility, and humility
as they understand the importance of working together as a team during
their performances.</p>
