<p>The CPS Young Artist Club is a vibrant hub of creativity and expression.
Open to students from P3 to P6, it serves as a platform for budding artists
to explore various mediums and techniques under the guidance of dedicated
teachers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meeting weekly after school hours, the club fosters a sense of camaraderie
among members who share a common passion for art. From painting and drawing
to sculpture and collage, there is something for everyone to delve into,
allowing students to discover and develop their artistic talents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The club not only focuses on honing technical skills but also encourages
students to express themselves freely, fostering self-confidence and creativity.
Through collaborative projects like stop-motion animation and themed activities
such as still life charcoal sketching, ceramics, or acrylic painting, members
learn to appreciate diverse perspectives and styles, enriching their artistic
experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Occasional exhibitions and showcases provide opportunities for students
to proudly display their creations, fostering a sense of achievement and
pride in their work. The CPS Young Artist Club not only nurtures young
artists but also instils in its members a lifelong love for art and creativity,
leaving a lasting impact on their school experience.</p>

<p>"Young Artist Club (YAC) is a place where I can express my artistic skills.
I barely have any time at home to pursue my passion for art due to preparations
for PSLE, tests, and other circumstances. By joining YAC, I find myself
able to relax every week because it provides me with a space to be in touch
with my creative and artistic side. Being an artist is my passion, and
I hope to continue it in secondary school. YAC has provided everything
I need as an important foundation."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nur Nuhaa Zerina Mohammed Rizal from Responsibility 1 (2024), President
of YAC</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Young Artist Club allows me to contribute through collaborative art projects,
and the teachers are both patient and helpful. They let us explore different
types of art mediums and hone our skills in them. They even invite guests
and instructors to conduct enrichment art modules outside of the art curriculum
so we can learn from them. For those who wish to join YAC, I highly recommend
it because the teachers here are very kind and helpful; they are always
around whenever I need them."</p>
