<p>The CPS Young Artist Club is a vibrant hub of creativity and expression.
Open to students across P3 to P6s, it served as a platform for budding
artists to explore various mediums and techniques under the guidance of
dedicated teachers.</p>
<p>Meeting weekly after school hours, the club fostered a sense of camaraderie
among members, who shared a common passion for Art. From painting and drawing
to sculpture and collage, there was something for everyone to delve into,
allowing each student to discover and develop their artistic talents. The
club not only focused on honing technical skills but also encouraged students
to express themselves freely, fostering self-confidence and creativity.</p>
<p>Through collaborative projects like Stop motion and themed activities
like Still Life Charcoal sketching, Ceramics or Acrylic Painting, members
learned to appreciate diverse perspectives and styles, enriching their
artistic experiences. Occasional exhibitions and showcases provided opportunities
for students to proudly display their creations, fostering a sense of achievement
and pride in their work.</p>
<p>The CPS Young Artist Club not only nurtured young artists but also instilled
in its members a lifelong love for Art and creativity, leaving a lasting
impact on their school experience.</p>

<p>“Young Artist Club is a place where I can express my artistic skills.
I barely have any time at home to pursue my passion in Art due to preparations
for PSLE, tests and other circumstances. By joining YAC, I find myself
being able to relax every week because it provides me with a space to be
in touch with my creative and artistic side. Being an artist is my passion
and I hope to continue it in secondary school. YAC has provided everything
I need as an important foundation.”</p>

<p>Nur Nuhaa Zerina Mohammed Rizal from Responsibility 1 (2024), President
of YAC</p>

<p>“Young Artist Club allows me to contribute through collaborative Art projects
and the teachers are both patient and helpful. They let us explore different
types of Art mediums and hone our skills in them. They even invite guests
and instructors to conduct enrichment Art modules outside of Art curriculum
so we can learn from them. Those who wishes to join YAC, I do recommend
them to join us as the teachers here are very kind and helpful; they are
always around whenever I needed them.”</p>
