<p>The CPS choir is a harmonious assembly of students who come together to
express themselves through the power of music. Comprising voices from various
grades and backgrounds, the choir cultivates teamwork, discipline, and
creativity. Rehearsing diligently under the guidance of a skilled conductor,
members refine their vocal techniques and learn to blend their voices seamlessly,
producing captivating melodies and stirring harmonies. Through performances
at school events, concerts, and competitions, the choir not only entertains
but also fosters a sense of community and pride within the school. It is
a space where individual talents converge to create something greater than
the sum of its parts, leaving a lasting impact on both performers and audiences
alike.</p>

<p>“I have made many friends in Choir. The vocal coaches train us well and
help us along the way with any problems. I am very grateful for joining
Choir.”</p>
<p></p>

<p>“My experience in Choir was very interesting. I have made a lot of new
friends. Being in Choir is very fun. Everyone supports you, and they are
very encouraging. I have gained a lot from Choir. For example, I have learned
different notes in a song. I have also learned to work well as a team from
this CCA. The vocal coach has guided me patiently and always encourages
me to do better. I appreciate everything the teachers, vocal coach, and
choir members have done for me.”</p>
