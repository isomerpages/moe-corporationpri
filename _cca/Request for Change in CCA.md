<p><strong><u>Request for Change in CCA</u></strong>
<br><em>(Applicable to Primary 4 and 5 students only)</em>
</p>
<p>Students are <strong>strongly encouraged to remain in the same CCA from Primary 3 to 6</strong>,
as sustained participation supports the development of perseverance, teamwork,
and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Requests for change in CCA are generally <strong>discouraged</strong>.
The school recognises that <strong>exceptional circumstances</strong> may
arise (e.g. medical or well-being reasons, or a sustained mismatch with
the CCA). All requests will be reviewed on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>,
subject to clear justification and availability in the receiving CCA.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>Considerations for Requests for Change in CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>When reviewing requests, the school takes into consideration the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student’s <strong>participation and commitment</strong> in the current
CCA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>suitability of the CCA</strong> for the student</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>availability of vacancies</strong> in the receiving CCA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions are made to support students’ growth, ensure fairness across
CCAs, and maintain the smooth running of CCA programmes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Submission of a request for change <strong>does not guarantee approval</strong>,
and the school’s decision is final.</p>
<p><strong>While the request for change is being processed, students are required to continue attending their current CCA sessions as scheduled.</strong>
