Outdoor Education
=================

Outdoor Education module aims at providing pupils with orienteering skills, giving pupils the opportunity to be immersed in nature and appreciating the wonders of nature. They also learn the usefulness of plants and animals around them. We foster our pupilsâ€™ self-awareness on their strengths, weaknesses and to embrace themselves as unique individuals.
