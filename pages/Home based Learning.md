<h1>Home-based Learning</h1>
<h2>Home-Based Learning (HBL) Policy</h2>
<p>1. The objectives of our school's&nbsp;<strong>Home-based Learning (HBL)</strong>&nbsp;programme
is to keep your children engaged in learning when they are unable to attend
school because of school closure or Leave of Absence (LOA)/Stay Home Notice
(SHN) etc. Our HBL programme will also mitigate the loss in curriculum
time in the event of prolonged school closure.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The school&nbsp;aligned HBL programme with the Scheme of Work
(SOW) for all subjects so that pupils on LOA/SHN do not lose out.&nbsp;
The school also&nbsp;ensures that learning continues in both academic and
student development domains (e.g. CCE); and both examinable and non-examinable
subjects. One thing to note is, HBL needs not be confined to e-learning
or learning with computers. It can include offline assignments or readings.</p>
<p>3. The recommended number of HBL hours for primary level pupils each day,
including time taken to complete assignments is&nbsp;<strong>4 hours</strong>,
with a maximum of 2 hours of online learning.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Learning Space (SLS)</a>&nbsp;is
the key online platform for supporting our Home-Based Learning (HBL) measures.&nbsp;If
your child has issues logging in SLS, please call the General Office at
67957381 or 67954859. Alternatively you can click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/cpssls" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to
submit a service request&nbsp;with the name and class of your child.</p>
<p>5. To distribute system load and provide better user experience, and allow
households with multiple school-going children to share computing device,
we recommend staggering your children’s access to SLS. The following timetable
is for parents' reference:</p>

<p>6. Pupils’ HBL assignments will be monitored and assessed so that there
is feedback to learning.&nbsp;This can be in the form of assignments to
be submitted (via email), marked by teachers or auto-marked quizzes on
SLS.</p>
<p>7. In the event of prolonged HBL, the school will loan computing devices
to pupils without access to computer (desktop/laptop/tablet etc) and Internet
(Wifi/mobile data) at home. Each family may loan&nbsp;<strong>a maximum of 2 computers</strong>&nbsp;based
on needs and availability of devices. You may contact your child's Form
Teachers to make a loan request.</p>
<p>8. Parents can apply for the NEU PC Plus programme which offers low-income
households with student or person with disabilities the opportunity to
own a brand new computer at an affordable price. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/neu-pc-plus" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit
