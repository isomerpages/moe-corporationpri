Health Matters
==============

**Heavy School Bag**
--------------------

Pupils are not allowed to bring mobile phones, tablets,Â toys, electronic games and game cards to school. Your child will be given the class timetable. Please advise your child to bring only the necessary books for the day. Unnecessary items or books not required for the day should not be brought to school to avoid heavy school bags.

  

**Water Coolers**
-----------------

Water coolers are installed at convenient places all over the school. Please encourage your children to drink from the coolers and refill their bottles from them. This is healthier than drinking sweetened drinks.

---------------

1.  Have sufficient sleep.
    
2.  Sleep early and wake up early.
    
3.  Have regular exercises and games with your family and friends.
    
4.  Make leisure time an active time to keep fit as a family.
