<h1>Parent Support Group</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Our school strongly believes that education is a shared responsibility
and is committed to preparing our pupils for the future; we endeavour to
forge strong partnerships with parents so as to achieve the holistic development
of our pupils.</p>
<p>To strengthen and foster the partnership, the Parent Support Group (PSG)
was established with a strong PSG Exco who is the driving force in facilitating
the school activities and programmes. (&nbsp;<strong>Lead, Care, Inspire</strong>)</p>

<h4>Lead</h4>
<p><strong>Lead the Learner</strong> - Lead by the PSG Exco, the Parent Facilitators
trained by MCYS related well to the rest of the parents and shared parenting
tips with them through the Coffee Talks they conducted. This year, they
conducted four coffee talks, “Self Care”, “Don’t worry, be happy”, “ Love
Language” and “ How to communicate with your child”. They also conducted
a craft workshop on “Flowers with Stocking”.</p>
<p><strong>Lead the Learning </strong>- The PSG Exco draws out the best from
each other when they take the lead to enhance one another’s capabilities
through the formal and informal platforms such as the monthly PSG Exco
meetings, discussions and SFE Talks. Under SFE, they initiated many team
bonding activities to provide an unsual and memorable experience for the
parents to reflect on the challenges which they faced as parents. Through
these team bonding activities, they build relationships through fun and
play, strengthen ties with one another and reinforce the CPS PSG Guidelines.

<h4>Care</h4>
<p>Parents care for the pupils under their charge. They take on the role
as Reading Mums and Math Mums by guiding our weaker pupils in the morning
with their studies. They also chaperon pupils out for school enrichment
programmes and learning journeys and thus, showing care and concern for
the well-being of each child.</p>
<h4>Inspire</h4>
<p>Great Teachers inspire through the love of their subjects, skilful teaching
and care they showed their pupils. Great parents inspire through their
involvement in school programmes , guidance in the child’s work and collaboration
with the school. The PSG also inspires our pupils through its active involvement
in the SFE programmes such as the “Eat with your family day” where pupils
are taught how to prepare and cook some simple dishes. Members of the PSG
also collaborate with the school in the school events such as the Craft
work at Chinese New Year, Gift for Teachers’ Day and Carnival Games for
Mid-Autumn Kaleidoscope. They inspire one another to go the extra mile
for the pupils and make a difference to their holistic development.</p>
