Visitors to school
==================

Parents / Guardians visiting the school to look for their children or to meet teachers would need to register at the security guard counter with their identity card before proceeding further.

For security reasons and safety of our pupils, no one is allowed to enter the school premises without the visitor pass which is issued only at the security guard counter. Teachers and other members of the staff have been instructed to check on strangers in the school premises.  Please display the pass issued to you prominently.  

Restricted Timings
------------------

  

As the gate would be very crowded and busy during dismissal, parents would not be allowed to enter the school premises due to safety concerns. Please refer to the table below for the restricted timings.
