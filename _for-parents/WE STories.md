#### WE STories 2020
---------------

**WE STories** is a compilation of stories from all West Zone secondary schools, which we hope would provide Primary 5 & Primary 6 pupils with information about the strengths and distinctiveness of each secondary school. This will help them make good choices on the secondary schools that best suit their needs, interests and aspirations. 

2020 version of **WE STories** is digital-only and enhanced to enable browsing by geographical location, ALP and LLP, and DSA talent areas.
