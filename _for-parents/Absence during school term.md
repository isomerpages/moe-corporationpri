<h1>Absence during school term</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pupils must attend school regularly and punctually so as not to miss any
lesson and be disadvantaged.&nbsp; However, if one child is ill or has
a severe cold / fever / contagious or infectious disease, please inform
the school and do not send him / her to the school.&nbsp; Any absence from
school must be covered by a doctorâ€™s medical certificate or a letter from
the parent/guardian upon return to the school. The child is to submit the
Medical Certificate to his/her Form Teacher. When a child falls ill while
in school, he/she may go to the sick bay in the General Office. His/Her
parents or guardians will be contacted to pick him/her up. Please take
note that only the parents or guardians will be allowed to take the child
home.</p>
