Absence during school term
==================

Overview
--------

  

Pupils must attend school regularly and punctually so as not to miss any lesson and be disadvantaged.  However, if one child is ill or has a severe cold / fever / contagious or infectious disease, please inform the school and do not send him / her to the school.  Any absence from school must be covered by a doctor’s medical certificate or a letter from the parent/guardian upon return to the school. The child is to submit the Medical Certificate to his/her Form Teacher. When a child falls ill while in school, he/she may go to the sick bay in the General Office. His/Her parents or guardians will be contacted to pick him/her up. Please take note that only the parents or guardians will be allowed to take the child home.
