<h1>Absence during school term</h1>
<p>Students must attend school regularly and punctually so as not to miss
any lesson and be at a disadvantage. However, a student should not attend
school when he / she is ill. Parents / Guardians should inform the form
teacher and ensure the absence is covered by a doctor’s medical certificate
(MC) or letter*. Parents / Guardians may submit MCs and letters either
in hardcopy or through Parents Gateway. When a student falls ill while
in school, only the parent / guardian will be allowed to take him / her
home.</p>
<p><em>*The number of letters accepted will be limited to 5 per semester, and each letter should cover no more than 2 days. If a student exceeds the accepted number of letters per semester, subsequent absences will be taken as invalid absences, which will affect his / her conduct grade.</em>
</p>
<p>Absence from school without a valid reason is a school offence. Non-valid
reasons include oversleeping and willful absence from school. Travelling
during term time is generally not considered a valid reason for absence.
Parents / Guardians who wish to take their children / wards overseas for
vacation and / or to attend to personal matters should do so during the
school holidays. Should there be any urgent need to travel, parents are
requested to submit the request via Parents Gateway with the reason clearly
stated.</p>
<p>On the day of a student’s absence, the form teacher will contact the parents
/ guardian to check on the student. If a student is absent frequently,
the form teacher or other school personnel may conduct a home visit. Should
there be no improvement in the student’s attendance, his / her parents
/ guardian will be requested to meet the principal for a discussion.</p>
