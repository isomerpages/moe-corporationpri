Counselling Services
====================

**What is School Counselling?**
-------------------------------

Pupils’ academic performance, self-esteem and relationships with others can be affected if they are going through difficult times or have personal problems. The counselling process allows pupils with difficult situations to talk about their problems in a safe environment and to enable them to develop effective coping skills and insights to make better decisions for problem-solving.

  

**The School Counsellor**
