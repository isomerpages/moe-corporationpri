Admission & School Transfer
===========================

**2022 P1 Registration Exercise**  

------------------------------------

  

Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR) child born between 2 Jan 2016 and 1 Jan 2017 (both dates inclusive) and has a sibling studying in Corporation Primary School.

If you have a SC or PR child eligible for Phase 1, please submit the online form at [https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform](https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform)  by **25 May 2022**. The school will contact you if additional clarifications and / or documents are required.

If your child is non-SC / non-PR and thus not eligible for Phase 1, please submit an online Indication of Interest between 31 May 2022 and 6 Jun 2022.

You may refer to the MOE website at [go.gov.sg/P1reg](http://go.gov.sg/P1reg) for updates on the 2022 P1 Registration exercise.
