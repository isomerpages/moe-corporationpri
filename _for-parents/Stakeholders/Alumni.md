Alumni
======

**Introduction**

  

CPS Alumni was humbly set up since 2015, the year which CPS celebrated its 40th Anniversary. It was heartening to have ex-pupils of CPS from different batches coming forth to want to be part of the Alumni. Since then efforts on working with the Alumni members to support and contribute back to CPS in our programmes started. Slowly but surely, CPS Alumni will grow to become a more robust team of alumnus coming back to extend their contributions as part of the CPS Family.
