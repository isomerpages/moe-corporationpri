<h4>WE- STories Publication 2023</h4>
<hr>
<p>The school would like to share the WE-STories publication for West Zone
(WZ) Secondary schools. Through this WE-STories publication, you will discover
the strengths and distinctiveness of WZ secondary schools in a narrative,
story-telling style.</p>
<p>We hope that WE-STories could spark meaningful conversations when you
guide your child in making informed choices in his/her transition to secondary
schools based on his/her interests and strengths.</p>
