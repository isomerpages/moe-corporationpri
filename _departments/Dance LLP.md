<h1>Dance LLP</h1>
<p><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) – Creativity Through Dance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s Dance LLP began as a niche area in 2013, focusing on nurturing
talent and creativity through dance. Besides an avenue for values inculcation,
the LLP has now evolved to become a platform for students to embrace diversity
and lifelong learning, where students are nurtured in their passion and
talents and developed in their character through holistic education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 3 tiers of the Dance LLP framework in Corporation Primary School
aim to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;build confidence in pupils towards performing arts in the area of
dance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;expose pupils to the different dance forms&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;allow pupils to express their creativity through dance!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience: School-Wide Exposure Dance Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>For school-wide exposure to dance and cultivation of interest, the following
programmes are planned for the pupils:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>LLP Dance Exposure Assembly Programme&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPS Dance – a unique mass dance specially choreographed for the school&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>House Dance – a mass dance for the school’s yearly Sports Carnival</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enrich: Level Dance Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Dance lessons of specific genres are infused within the PE and Music formal
curriculum for every level, to enrich students’ exposure and experience
in dance. Through these programmes, students are taught the fundamental
dance techniques and they are given the opportunities to create dance movements
and choreograph their dance routines in accordance to the music for performance
in groups or as a class. The intent is to allow students to learn more
about elements of dance and experience the learning of dance as a Creator
(creating a dance), an Active audience (critiquing, appreciating and understanding
the elements of dance) and a Performer (presenting a dance).</p>
