<h1>Dance LLP</h1>
<p><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) – Creativity Through Dance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s Dance LLP began as a niche area in 2013, focusing on nurturing
talent and creativity through dance. Besides an avenue for values inculcation,
the LLP has now evolved to become a platform for students to embrace diversity
and lifelong learning, where students are nurtured in their passion and
talents and developed in their character through holistic education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 3 tiers of the Dance LLP framework in Corporation Primary School
aim to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;build confidence in pupils towards performing arts in the area of
dance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;expose pupils to the different dance forms&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;allow pupils to express their creativity through dance</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experience: School-Wide Exposure Dance Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>For school-wide exposure to dance and cultivation of interest, the following
programmes are planned for the pupils:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>LLP Dance Exposure Assembly Programme&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPS Dance – a unique mass dance specially choreographed for the school&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>House Dance – a mass dance for the school’s yearly Sports Carnival</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enrich: Level Dance Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Dance lessons of specific genres are infused within the PE and Music formal
curriculum for every level, to enrich students’ exposure and experience
in dance. Through these programmes, students are taught the fundamental
dance techniques and they are given the opportunities to create dance movements
and choreograph their dance routines in accordance to the music for performance
in groups or as a class. The intent is to allow students to learn more
about elements of dance and experience the learning of dance as a <strong>C</strong>reator
(creating a dance), an <strong>A</strong>ctive audience (critiquing, appreciating
and understanding the elements of dance) and a <strong>P</strong>erformer
(presenting a dance).</p>

<p><strong>Shine: Specialised Dance Learning and Performance Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>Dance Performances by Dance CCA groups</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In Corporation Primary School, we have 3 Dance CCA groups – Chinese Dance,
Malay Dance and Hip Hop Dance. Other than participating in the SYF, they
also perform for school events such as the Annual Prize-Giving, National
Day and cultural celebrations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dance Leadership Programme by Dance CCA groups</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This programme offers student dancers a unique opportunity to cross over
into other dance CCAs for a varied and enriching learning experience. As
they explore different dance genres and training styles, they also develop
leadership and reflection skills by sharing their insights and experiences
with the school community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dance Fiesta by Dance CCA groups</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An inter-school dance CCA exchange where students come together to explore
unique and exciting dance forms beyond their regular programmes. From the
rhythmic beats of Maculelê to the grace of Indian Dance and the dynamic
flair of Diabolo, this vibrant event celebrates cultural diversity, creative
expression, and the joy of learning through movement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Student Dance Interest groups</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dance Interest Groups provide a supportive space for like-minded students
to come together twice a week before morning assembly. In this self-directed
setting, students explore dance styles of their choice, exchange ideas,
and grow through independent practice and peer learning. They also have
the opportunity to perform for various school events such as Teachers’
Day and Pre-assembly programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Celebrating Our Students’ Dance Journey: Arts In Our Hearts LLP Online Publication (Volume 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>We are proud to present the third and final volume of our LLP publication
— a vibrant culmination of our students’ dance journey. This book goes
beyond movement and performance; it captures how dance has shaped our students'
character, resilience, and sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Inside, you'll find a heartfelt collection of poems, comics, diary entries,
and personal stories — each piece thoughtfully written and illustrated
by our P 5 and P6 students as they reflect on their experiences, growth,
and achievements throughout the programme. This publication celebrates
not only their artistic expression but also the life lessons learned through
dance.</p>
<p>Through this Learning for Life Programme, our students have gained valuable
skills and values that extend beyond the stage — learning to collaborate,
persevere, and express themselves confidently. These are enduring qualities
that will continue to guide and support them in their lifelong learning
journey.</p>
