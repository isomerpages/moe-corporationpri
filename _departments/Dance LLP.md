<h1>Dance LLP</h1>
<p><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) – Creativity Through Dance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s LLP started off as a niche area in 2013, focusing on nurturing
talent and creativity through dance. Besides being used as a platform for
values inculcation, the LLP has now evolved to become a platform for pupils
to embrace diversity and lifelong learning, where pupils are nurtured in
their passion and talents and developed in their character through holistic
education. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 3 tiers of the Dance LLP framework in Corporation Primary School
aim to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;build confidence in pupils towards performing arts in the area of
dance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;expose pupils to the different dance forms&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;allow pupils to express their creativity through dance!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enrich: Level Dance Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>There are different dance programmes infused within the formal curriculum
for every level, to enrich pupils’ exposure and experience in various genres
of dance. Through these programmes, pupils are taught the fundamental dance
techniques and they are given the opportunities to create dance movements
and choreograph their dance routines in accordance to the music for performance
in groups or as a class. The intent is to allow pupils to learn more about
elements of dance and experience the learning of dance as a&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>reator
(creating a dance), an&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ctive audience (critiquing,
appreciating and understanding the elements of dance) and a&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>erformer
(presenting a dance).</p>
