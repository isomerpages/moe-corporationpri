<h3><strong><u>Mathematics in CPS</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Nurturing confident and curious students who
are independent and creative problem-solvers</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: To nurture future-ready students by developing
their mastery in Mathematics through joy of learning</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%20Framework.png">
</div>
<p>The Mathematics Framework has been the cornerstone of the Mathematics
Curriculum. It involves the acquisition and application of Mathematics
concepts and skills in a wide range of situations including non-routine,
open-ended and real-world problems. The development of mathematical-problem-solving
ability is dependent on five inter-related components, which are namely
Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.</p>
<p>In Corporation Primary School, we seek to develop the five components
in each of our students through our school-based curriculum. We want to
engage our students with learning experiences, which promote authenticity
and connect to real-life applications to stimulate the interest in their
learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Key Highlights</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023a.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<br>Our school adopts the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach which
is a system of learning that uses physical and visual aids to build a child’s
mathematical understanding of abstract topic. During the early stages of
learning a new mathematical concept and/or process, students use various
manipulatives and visual aids to strengthen and build their mastery of
learning of abstract topics.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaborative Inquiry Based Learning (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Math/24_Col_IBL.jpg">
</div>
<p>The department has been incorporating an inquiry-based learning package
on a termly basis for the learning of Mathematics in the classroom since
2021. During this session, teachers present scenarios/ problems to students
and engage students in a discussion. The teacher guides the students by
asking scaffolded and in-depth questions and get them to present their
thought processes collaboratively. While focusing on critical thinking
skills, the students are also encouraged to voice their different solutions
and views on the problems. These lessons will also help students deepen
their concepts in selected topics and thus aid them in problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>3. Math Journaling</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Math/24_Math_Journaling.jpg">
</div>
<p>Mathematics Journal assists in assessing students’ thinking and promotes
communication skills. It consolidates learning and allows students to reflect
on the learning in the classroom. Journals can mainly be investigative,
affective and procedural in nature.</p>
<p><strong>4. Infusion of Mathematics in Authentic Real-Life Context</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Level Engagement Tasks (LET)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our efforts to provide students the opportunity to experience
authentic learning tasks and to promote the joy of learning, Level Engagement
Tasks are done at every level. The tasks allow students to develop a strong
conceptual understanding in Mathematics as they experience the application
of Mathematics in real-life contexts. In addition, the tasks are designed
to stretch students’ adaptive thinking and critical thinking as they look
for various solutions to solve the tasks.</p>

<p>In line with the topic on Whole Numbers and Four Operations, the P5 students
were tasked to design their own mathematics games. They needed to apply
the concepts of what they have learnt about whole numbers and the four
operations in their game rules. Groups were given time to play with one
another’s games during Mathematics lessons. Selected games were also displayed
during lunch time for students of other levels to play with.</p>
<p><strong>5. Heuristics Skills (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Heuristics are problem solving strategies that students can adopt to solve
routine and non-routine word problems. Students from all levels are taught
a set of heuristic skills during their Mathematics lessons. They will also
be exposed to a variety of problems that allow them to apply the heuristics.</p>
<p><strong>6. ICT – based Lesson (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023f.jpg">
</div>
<p>We aim to nurture confident and curious students who are independent and
creative problem solvers. Students are given the opportunity to experience
ICT in classroom lessons, taking ownership of their own learning. Teachers
use various platforms to engage them in the learning of Mathematics such
as Geogebra, Koobits and Student Learning Space (SLS), For Student Learning
Space (SLS), Mathematics teachers work together regularly to craft out
different lessons for the students. Teachers assign these SLS lessons as
homework or use them in class to complement the face-to-face lessons concurrently.</p>
<p>Our students are also encouraged to engage in independent learning at
home via KooBits, an online Mathematics platform. Students can learn at
their own pace by trying out various Mathematics questions and word problems.
Teachers also use the Quiz function to assess students’ learning. Besides
solving Mathematics questions, the portal also provides interesting Mathematics
stories and games to motivate students and make Mathematics learning more
fun and enjoyable.</p>
