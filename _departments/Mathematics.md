<h3><strong>Mathematics in CPS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Nurturing confident and curious students who
are independent and creative problem-solvers</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: To nurture future-ready students by developing
their mastery in Mathematics through joy of learning</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%20Framework.png">
</div>
<p>The Mathematics Framework has been the cornerstone of the Mathematics
Curriculum. It involves the acquisition and application of Mathematics
concepts and skills in a wide range of situations including non-routine,
open-ended and real-world problems. The development of mathematical-problem-solving
ability is dependent on five inter-related components, which are namely
Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.</p>
<p>In Corporation Primary School, we seek to develop the five components
in each of our students through our school-based curriculum. We want to
engage our students with learning experiences, which promote authenticity
and connect to real-life applications to stimulate the interest in their
learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Key Highlights</strong></h3>
<h3>2025 in Summary – Mathematics is Fun Activities</h3>

</div>
<p>With the plethora of activities designed throughout the year to infuse
joy in students’ learning of Mathematics, we hope that they will find the
subject enjoyable and meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to the engaging activities organised during Pre-Assembly sharing
and lunch-time sessions, the department has also implemented several key
approaches and programmes to further support and enhance students’ mathematical
development.</p>
<p><strong>1. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023a.jpg">
</div>
<p>Our school adopts the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach which
is a system of learning that uses physical and visual aids to build a child’s
mathematical understanding of abstract topics. When learning a new mathematical
concept or process, especially in the early stages, students use various
manipulatives and visual aids to deepen their understanding and develop
mastery of abstract topics.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaborative Inquiry Based Learning (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Math/24_Col_IBL.jpg">
</div>
<p>The department has been incorporating an inquiry-based learning package
on a termly basis for the learning of Mathematics in the classroom since
2021. During this session, teachers present scenarios/ problems to students
and engage them in a discussion. The teachers guide the students by asking
scaffolded and in-depth questions and get them to present their thought
processes collaboratively. While focusing on critical thinking skills,
the students are also encouraged to voice their different solutions and
views on the problems. These lessons will also help students deepen their
concepts in selected topics and thus aid them in problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>3. Math Journaling</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Math/24_Math_Journaling.jpg">
</div>
<p>Mathematics Journal assists in assessing students’ thinking and promotes
communication skills. It consolidates learning and allows students to reflect
on learning in the classroom. Journals can mainly be investigative, affective
and procedural in nature.</p>
<p><strong>4. Infusion of Mathematics in Authentic Real-Life Context</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Level Engagement Tasks (LET)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our efforts to provide students with the opportunity to experience
authentic learning tasks and to promote the joy of learning, Level Engagement
Tasks are done at every level. The tasks allow students to develop a strong
conceptual understanding of Mathematics as they experience the application
of Mathematics in real-life contexts. In addition, the tasks are designed
to stretch students’ adaptive thinking and critical thinking as they look
for various solutions to solve the tasks.</p>

<p><strong>P1 Learning Journey to Marina Barrage and Gardens by the Bay</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The P1 students visited Gardens by the Bay, where they learned to apply
the concept of time by planning their own schedules for the outing. They
concluded their learning journey with a kite-flying session at Marina Barrage.
This experience provided them with an authentic opportunity to apply what
they had learned in a real-life setting while also building teamwork among
their peers.</p>

<p>In collaboration with other departments such as English and Social Studies,
the P2 students visited Changi Airport. This experience allowed them to
apply the concepts of money, time, and the measurement of length and mass
in a real-world context. At the same time, it helped develop their occupational
awareness, strengthened the connections to their STELLAR unit ‘Postcards
to David’ and fostered their collaborative skills.</p>

<p><strong>5. Heuristics Skills (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Heuristics are problem solving strategies that students can adopt to solve
routine and non-routine word problems. Students from all levels are taught
a set of heuristic skills during their Mathematics lessons. They will also
be exposed to a variety of problems that allow them to apply heuristics.</p>
<p><strong>6. ICT – based Lesson (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to experience ICT in classroom lessons,
taking ownership of their own learning. Teachers use various platforms
to engage them in the learning of Mathematics such as Geogebra, Koobits
and Student Learning Space (SLS).</p>
<p>Mathematics teachers work together regularly to craft out different lessons
for the students on SLS. These SLS lessons are assigned as homework or
used in class to complement the face-to-face lessons concurrently.</p>
<p>Our students are also encouraged to engage in independent learning at
home via Koobits. Students can learn at their own pace by trying out various
Mathematics questions. Teachers also use the Quiz function to assess students’
learning. There are also interesting Mathematics stories and games available
to motivate students and make Mathematics learning more enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>9. Mathematics Week (T2W10)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our second Mathematics Week took place in Term 2 Week 10 this year. Through
well-designed school-wide activities, the department strives to foster
lifelong learning and appreciation of Mathematics in our students. Students
participated in assembly programme – Math Magic Show, Math Movie Screening,
lunch activities and booths activities set up in collaboration with students
from ACS Barker and Jurongville Secondary Schools. Students experienced
the joy of learning Mathematics beyond the syllabus and were empowered
to engage in self-directed learning.</p>

<p><strong>10. Enrichment Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>To make learning Mathematics more meaningful for our students, the department
also worked with different stakeholders to conduct various mathematical
workshops, infusing the mathematical topics that the students have learned
into various hands-on activities for the students to apply their conceptual
understanding.</p>

<h3><strong>How can you support your child in the learning of Mathematics?</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Work on their factual fluency (eg. Times table, division etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily exposure to Mathematics word problems (Practice 5 questions per
day) and variety of questions</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss with your child’s Mathematics teacher on your child’s progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage your child to have a Growth Mindset (e.g Asking for help is
never something to be afraid of, The Power of Yet, Overcoming the fear
of failure)</p>
