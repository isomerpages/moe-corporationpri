Mathematics
===========

  
**Vision**: Nurturing confident and curious pupils who are independent and creative problem- solvers

**Mission**: To nurture future-ready students by developing their mastery in Mathematics through joy of learning

**MOE Mathematics Framework**
![](/images/Math%20Framework.png)

The Mathematics Framework has been the cornerstone of the Mathematics Curriculum. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems. The development of mathematical- problem-solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, which are namely Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.

In Corporation Primary School, we seek to develop the five components in each of our students through our school-based curriculum. We want to engage our students with learning experiences, which promote authenticity and connect to real life applications to stimulate the interest in their learning.  


**Our Key Highlights** 
-----------------------

1\. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) (P1 - P6)

![](/images/Math%202023a.jpg)  
Our school adopted the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach which is a system of learning that uses physical and visual aids to build a child’s mathematical understanding of abstract topic. During the early stages of learning a new mathematical concept and/or process, pupils use various manipulatives and visual aids to strengthen and build their mastery of learning of abstract topics. 

  
2\. Collaborative Inquiry Based Learning  (P1 - P6)

The department has been incorporating an Inquiry Based Learning package on a termly basis for the learning of Mathematics in the classroom since 2021. During this session, teachers present scenarios/ problems to students and engage students in a discussion. The teacher guides the students by asking scaffolded and in-depth questions and getting them to present their thought processes collaboratively.  While focusing on critical thinking skills, the students are also encouraged to voice their different solutions and views on the problems. These lessons will also help students deepen their concepts in selected topics and thus aid them in problem solving.

3\. Math Journaling

Math Journals assist in assessing pupils’ thinking and promotes communication skills in pupils. It consolidates learning and allows pupils to reflect on the learning in the classroom. Journals can mainly be Investigative, Affective and Procedural in nature.

  

4\. Infusion of Mathematics in Authentic Real-Life Situations

-Level Engagement Tasks  (P1 - P6)

As part of our efforts to provide pupils the opportunity to experience authentic learning tasks and to promote the joy of learning, Level Engagement Tasks are done in every level. The tasks aim to allow pupils to have a strong conceptual understanding in Mathematics as they experience the application of Mathematics in real-life contexts.

-P1 Shopping Trip to IMM 

In line with the topic, Money, the P1 pupils will be going for a shopping trip to GIANT supermarket at IMM shopping centre to purchase items for a Class Party that they will be tasked to plan in groups. Prior to the trip, the pupils will be involved in planning and budgeting for the items that need to be purchased for the party. This experience provides pupils an opportunity to apply the concept of money in a real-life situation and at the same time develop financial literacy and collaborative skills.

-P5 Open-Ended Task - Making of a Math Game

In line with the topic on Whole Numbers and Four Operations, the P5s were tasked to design their own Math games. They need to apply the concepts of what they have learned about whole numbers and the four operations in their game rules. Groups were given time to play with each other’s games during Math lessons.

5\. Heuristics Skills (P1 - P6)

Heuristics are problem solving strategies that pupils can adopt to solve routine and non-routine word problems. Pupils from all levels would be taught a set of Heuristic Skills during their Math lessons. They will also be exposed to a variety of problems that would allow them to apply the heuristics.



6\. ICT – based Lesson (P1 - P6) 

Pupils are given the opportunity to experience and harness ICT in classroom lessons. Teachers use various platforms to engage pupils in the learning of Mathematics such as Geogebra, Koobits and Student Learning Space (SLS), One such platform is the Student Learning Space (SLS). Mathematics teachers came together to craft out different lessons for the pupils. Teachers assigned these SLS lessons as homework or use them in class to complement the face-to-face lessons concurrently.

7\. Sudoku Mathematics (P3 - P6)

Sudoku Mathematics promotes pupils’ logical thinking and enhance their problem-solving abilities as they engage in different levels of solving the Sudoku activities. It started out as a practice in class 30 minutes a week during Math lessons. The teachers also encourage the pupils to do Sudoku as part of filler activity. After weeks of practise, the pupils participated in an inter-class competition where the top 3 competed with  others from the different classes.

8\. Koobits Weekly Quizzes (P1-P6)

In CPS, we aim to nurture confident and curious students who are independent and creative problem- solvers. Our students are able to do so by engaging in independent learning at home via KooBits, an online Mathematics platform.  Students can learn at their own pace by trying out various Mathematics questions and word problems. Besides solving Math questions, the portal also provides interesting Math stories and games to motivate students and make Math learning more fun and enjoyable. Students also participate in weekly KooBits Stars Quizzes. The quizzes include questions which aim to promote the mastery of factual fluency and basic skills at each level. At the end of each term, students stand to earn a prize for performing consistently well in the quizzes!

  
9\. Supporting Programmes: 

-Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM - P1 - P3)

Selected pupils are supported through the LSM Programme to deepen their understanding of Mathematics. This programme comprises customised, well-paced lessons that will support the pupils in the learning of Math.

-ICAN Mathematics (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy)

The MOE ICAN Math learning aims to improve the pupils’ confidence level in numeracy. This programme is for selected classes and it provides pupils a systematic approach to learning Mathematics.

  

10\. Stretch Programmes:

-Math Olympiad (P4 - P6)

The Math Olympiad for selected P4 to P6 pupils aims to stretch the pupils’ mathematical thinking skills through solving routine and non-routine problems based on different mathematical topics that require pupils to exercise their critical and logical thinking skills. Pupils from the Math Olympiad programme are also given the opportunity to participate in the following competitions to apply their knowledge and skills.

     - Hwa Chong Institution (SMOPS)  
     - Raffles Instituition (RIPMWC)  
     - River Valley High   
     - NUS High (NMOS)  
     - Annual Mathlympics 

-E2K Mathematics (P4 - P6)

P4 to P6 pupils who display an aptitude and potential for Mathematics are invited to participate in the E2K Mathematics Programme. This programme aims to develop and stretch higher-order thinking skills through a range of problem solving problems. 


**How can you support your child in the learning of Mathematics?** 
-----------------------



* Work on their factual fluency (eg. Times table, division etc)
* Daily exposure to Math word problems (Practice 5 questions per day) and variety of questions
* Encourage your child to complete his/her Math homework diligently 
* Link to real-life experiences at home (eg. discount coupons, newspapers, advertisements etc)
* Monitor your child’s learning process at home 
* Use Koobits for self-study
* Revise topics from P3 to P6 starting from Term 1 (Math is spiral in nature and therefore there is a need to have a strong foundation.)
* Discuss with Math Teacher on your child’s progress
* Encourage your child to have a Growth Mindset (e.g Asking for help is never something to be afraid of, The Power of Yet, Overcoming the fear of failure)
