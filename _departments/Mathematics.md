<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Nurturing confident and curious students who
are independent and creative problem-solvers</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: To nurture future-ready students by developing
their mastery in Mathematics through joy of learning</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%20Framework.png">
</div>
<p>The Mathematics Framework has been the cornerstone of the Mathematics
Curriculum. It involves the acquisition and application of Mathematics
concepts and skills in a wide range of situations including non-routine,
open-ended and real-world problems. The development of mathematical-problem-solving
ability is dependent on five inter-related components, which are namely
Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.</p>
<p>In Corporation Primary School, we seek to develop the five components
in each of our students through our school-based curriculum. We want to
engage our students with learning experiences, which promote authenticity
and connect to real life applications to stimulate the interest in their
learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Our Key Highlights</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023a.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<br>Our school adopts the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach which
is a system of learning that uses physical and visual aids to build a child’s
mathematical understanding of abstract topic. During the early stages of
learning a new mathematical concept and/or process, students use various
manipulatives and visual aids to strengthen and build their mastery of
learning of abstract topics.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaborative Inquiry Based Learning (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math_dep_collaborative_inquiry_based_learning__website_.jpg">
</div>
<p>The department has been incorporating an Inquiry Based Learning package
on a termly basis for the learning of Mathematics in the classroom since
2021. During this session, teachers present scenarios/ problems to students
and engage students in a discussion.</p>
<p>The teacher guides the students by asking scaffolded and in-depth questions
and getting them to present their thought processes collaboratively. While
focusing on critical thinking skills, the students are also encouraged
to voice their different solutions and views on the problems. These lessons
will also help students deepen their concepts in selected topics and thus
aid them in problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>3. Math Journaling</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math_dep_math_journal__website__jpg.png">
</div>
<p>Mathematics Journal assists in assessing students’ thinking and promotes
communication skills. It consolidates learning and allows students to reflect
on the learning in the classroom. Journals can mainly be investigative,
affective and procedural in nature.</p>
<p><strong>4. Infusion of Mathematics in Authentic Real-Life Situations</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023c.jpg">
</div>
<p>As part of our efforts to provide students the opportunity to experience
authentic learning tasks and to promote the joy of learning, Level Engagement
Tasks are done in every level. The tasks aim to allow students to have
a strong conceptual understanding in Mathematics as they experience the
application of Mathematics in real-life contexts.</p>

</div>
<p>In line with the topic, Money, the P1 students will be going for a shopping
trip to GIANT supermarket at IMM shopping centre to purchase items for
a class party that they will be tasked to plan in groups. Prior to the
trip, the students will be involved in planning and budgeting for the items
that need to be purchased for the party. This experience provides students
an opportunity to apply the concept of money in a real-life situation and
at the same time develop financial literacy and collaborative skills.</p>

</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023e.jpg">
</div>
<p>In line with the topic on Whole Numbers and Four Operations, the P5 students
were tasked to design their own Mathematics games. They need to apply the
concepts of what they have learned about whole numbers and the four operations
in their game rules. Groups were given time to play with each other’s games
during Mathematics lessons.</p>
<p><strong>5. Heuristics Skills (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Heuristics are problem solving strategies that students can adopt to solve
routine and non-routine word problems. Students from all levels would be
taught a set of heuristic skills during their Mathematics lessons. They
will also be exposed to a variety of problems that would allow them to
apply the heuristics.</p>
<p><strong>6. ICT – based Lesson (P1 - P6)</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Math%202023f.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to experience and harness ICT in classroom
lessons. Teachers use various platforms to engage them in the learning
of Mathematics such as Geogebra, Koobits and Student Learning Space (SLS),
One such platform is the Student Learning Space (SLS). Mathematics teachers
came together to craft out different lessons for the students. Teachers
assigned these SLS lessons as homework or use them in class to complement
the face-to-face lessons concurrently.</p>
<p>In CPS, we also aim to nurture confident and curious students who are
independent and creative problem-solvers. Our students are able to do so
by engaging in independent learning at home via KooBits, an online Mathematics
platform. Students can learn at their own pace by trying out various Mathematics
questions and word problems. Teachers also use the Quiz function to assess
students’ learning. Besides solving Mathematics questions, the portal also
provides interesting Mathematics stories and games to motivate students
and make Mathematics learning more fun and enjoyable. &nbsp;</p>
