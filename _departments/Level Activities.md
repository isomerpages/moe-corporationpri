P2 Integration of English and Science (A Butterfly is Born) 
------------------------------------------------------------

  

The Primary 2 pupils read an interesting STELLAR book on the life cycle of a butterfly during their English lessons.    
  
P2 pupils were very excited and decided to explore life cycle of other insects and animals. The pupils **watched videos, short stories and even went to garden to look out for caterpillars!** (Enthusiastic learners)![](/images/Caterpillar.jpg)

What was done during the English lessons?  

*    Teacher **tapped on prior knowledge** of pupils by getting them to recall the life cycle of butterfly based on the big book. 
*   **Class Discussion through questioning**: Introduction of Science topics: Life cycle of insects. Teacher merely facilitated the lesson by providing guided questions. (Example: How many stages are there in the life cycle of a mosquito/frog? What are animals called at the different stages?)
*    Pupils learnt the **similarities and differences of animals and insects at the different stages**. 
*    To facilitate pupils’ learning, the teachers **modelled** a Class Writing after which pupils **worked in small groups** to write their own stories on life cycles of animals. (collaborative learning)

*   During English lessons, pupils are also strongly encouraged to **express their opinions, thoughts and voice through Journal writing**.  Pupils were given a chance to write about their encounter with an animal or insect.![](/images/Insect.jpg)


P4/P5 Cyber-Sheriff Programme
-----------------------------

  

A group of P4 and P5 students were selected for this 2-day Cyberwellness workshop conducted on 22 and 23 September 2021. This issue on cyber-addiction was first surfaced in 2020 when the Primary 4 (for the P5 cohort) teachers highlighted that students were spending too much time online and some were already addicted to it such that their attendance in school and work quality were badly affected. In this workshop, students learnt how to display discerning attitude and appropriate behavior online (self). After this workshop, this group of students will be able to act as our school cyber-sheriffs peer supporters to identify potential cyber-addicts from the other levels (if any) and intervention from the school can be deployed before issue escalates.

P5/P6 CARE Programme
--------------------

  

The annual P5/P6 CARE Programme took place under strict safe management measures this year with two venues set up for the respective level students to be able to complete their homework in a conducive environment. The level teachers were rostered for the various sessions to provide basic coaching for the students as they complete their homework. Students were able to provide positive peer influence to each other as they completed and revised their work.
