<h3><strong>2025</strong></h3>
<h4>P6 Secondary School Roadshow</h4>
<p>We hosted a vibrant Cluster Secondary School Roadshow for the Primary
6 cohort, welcoming students from seven other cluster primary schools to
explore the diverse key programmes and co-curricular activities offered
by participating secondary schools. The event provided an engaging platform
for students to gain insights into secondary school life, make informed
choices, and be inspired for their next phase of learning. Adding to the
excitement, MOE Education and Career Guidance (ECG) personnel joined the
roadshow, bringing along the interactive Exhibit On-The-Move. Through hands-on
activities and engaging discussions, students had the opportunity to chart
their career aspirations and better understand the pathways available to
them in their educational journey.</p>

<h4>Keep-It-Right (KIR) Programme</h4>
<p>The Keep-It-Right (KIR) Programme was conducted for all Primary 1 to 6
students to help them start and continue the school year with the right
mindset. Through engaging activities and interactive sessions, the programme
reinforced key school messages on discipline and expectations, ensuring
that students have understood the importance of personal responsibility
and respect for others. It also provided meaningful opportunities to strengthen
teacher-student and student-student relationships, creating a supportive
and positive learning environment. By equipping students with essential
knowledge, skills, and attitudes, the Keep-It-Right Programme empowers
them to practise making good choices and strive for their personal best
throughout the year.</p>

<h3><strong>2024</strong></h3>
<h4>P6 Secondary School Roadshow</h4>
<p>Our Primary 6 students participated in a cluster Secondary School Roadshow
in Term 2 Week 9. This event was designed to offer a valuable opportunity
for students and their parents to learn about the distinctive programs
available at various secondary schools and explore Direct School Admission
(DSA) options. The roadshow aims to help Primary 6 students make informed
decisions about their secondary school choices after the PSLE.</p>
<p>This year, there was an exciting array of booths from 17 different secondary
schools. Our students enjoyed interacting with the student leaders from
these schools, gaining insights and information. We wish our students the
best of luck in their PSLE and hope they successfully gain admission to
their preferred secondary schools!</p>

<h4>P6 Keep-It-Right (KIR) Programme – CPS Junior Alumni &amp; Mdm Penny Chong Motivational Talks</h4>
<p>Term 3 at CPS began on a high note with the Keep-It-Right (KIR) programme
planned for various levels. Our Primary 6 students had the privilege of
listening to an inspiring motivational talk by Mdm Penny Chong, a visually-impaired
teacher from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School. She shared her life story,
detailing the challenges of losing her sight at a young age and her journey
to achieving her dreams, including participating in sports and aesthetic
activities during her school days and becoming a teacher in a mainstream
school.</p>
