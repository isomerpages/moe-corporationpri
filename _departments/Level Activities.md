P2 Integration of English and Science (A Butterfly is Born) 
------------------------------------------------------------

  

The Primary 2 pupils read an interesting STELLAR book on the life cycle of a butterfly during their English lessons.    
  
P2 pupils were very excited and decided to explore life cycle of other insects and animals. The pupils **watched videos, short stories and even went to garden to look out for caterpillars!** (Enthusiastic learners)![](/images/Caterpillar.jpg)

What was done during the English lessons?  

*    Teacher **tapped on prior knowledge** of pupils by getting them to recall the life cycle of butterfly based on the big book. 
*   **Class Discussion through questioning**: Introduction of Science topics: Life cycle of insects. Teacher merely facilitated the lesson by providing guided questions. (Example: How many stages are there in the life cycle of a mosquito/frog? What are animals called at the different stages?)
*    Pupils learnt the **similarities and differences of animals and insects at the different stages**. 
*    To facilitate pupils’ learning, the teachers **modelled** a Class Writing after which pupils **worked in small groups** to write their own stories on life cycles of animals. (collaborative learning)

*   During English lessons, pupils are also strongly encouraged to **express their opinions, thoughts and voice through Journal writing**.  Pupils were given a chance to write about their encounter with an animal or insect.![](/images/Insect.jpg)
