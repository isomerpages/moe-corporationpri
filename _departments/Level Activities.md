<h3>P6 Secondary School Roadshow </h3>
<p>Our Primary 6 students participated in a cluster Secondary School Roadshow
in Term 2 Week 9. This event was designed to offer a valuable opportunity
for students and their parents to learn about the distinctive programs
available at various secondary schools and explore Direct School Admission
(DSA) options. The roadshow aims to help Primary 6 students make informed
decisions about their secondary school choices after the PSLE.</p>
<p>This year, there was an exciting array of booths from 17 different secondary
schools. Our students enjoyed interacting with the student leaders from
these schools, gaining insights and information. We wish our students the
best of luck in their PSLE and hope they successfully gain admission to
their preferred secondary schools!</p>

<h3>P6 Keep-It-Right (KIR) Programme â€“ CPS Junior Alumni &amp; Mdm Penny Chong Motivational Talks</h3>
<p>Term 3 at CPS began on a high note with the Keep-It-Right (KIR) programme
planned for various levels. Our Primary 6 students had the privilege of
listening to an inspiring motivational talk by Mdm Penny Chong, a visually-impaired
teacher from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School. She shared her life story,
detailing the challenges of losing her sight at a young age and her journey
to achieving her dreams, including participating in sports and aesthetic
activities during her school days and becoming a teacher in a mainstream
school.</p>

<p>Our Primary 6 students also learned valuable stress management strategies
from their seniors, the Junior Alumni members, to aid them in their PSLE
preparation. This event provided an excellent start to the term, equipping
our students with inspiration and practical advice for the months ahead.</p>
