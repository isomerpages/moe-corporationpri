Overseas Learning Journeys
==========================

Overseas Immersion Programme to China ( 25 June to 29 June 2019)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  

A group of selected Primary 5 pupils went to China (Xiamen and Shantou) from 25 June to 29 June 2019 for an overseas immersion programme. The objective of the trip was to develop the cultural intelligence of our pupils so that they have global awareness and cross-cultural skills. It was a great exposure for the pupils to know what was happening in Asia and provided a platform to experience school life in China. The pupils visited the Shantou Chaoyang Experiment School as a part of their cultural exchange programme.&nbsp;

  

  

**Pupils’ sharing**

**Question: What was the best part of the trip?**&nbsp;

“I enjoyed meeting the pupils in the school and sleeping in the hostels,” Phone, Endurance 1.

  

“I enjoyed the paper-cutting activity. A famous master in paper cutting taught me!” Li Wen, Endurance 6.&nbsp;

  

**Question: What are the interesting things you learnt about Shantou Chaoyang Experimental School?**

“The students in the school take afternoon naps in their hostels. The beds are hard as they do not use mattress in summer,” Cherianne, Endurance 2.&nbsp;   

“I learnt a bit about Chinese calligraphy. I need patience when doing calligraphy,” Niyumi, Endurance 4.

Overseas Immersion Programme to&nbsp;Brunei (24 June to 27 June 2019)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  

A group of 20 Primary 5 pupils were selected to go for the 4D3N Overseas Immersion Programme to Brunei from 24 - 27 June. It was a fulfilling trip which provided opportunities for the pupils to learn and interact with Bruneian pupils to develop in them the 21st CC skills on global awareness and cross-cultural skills. The pupils also visited places that allowed them to have cultural immersion. It was the first time most of the pupils were away from their parents but they were able to be independent and enjoyed themselves tremendously.

  

**Pupils’ sharing:**&nbsp;

**Question: What did you learn from the trip?**&nbsp;

“I learnt to be more grateful and thankful that I have such big classrooms and play areas to play in,” Muhammad Danzil, Endurance 1.

  

“I learnt to appreciate more the facilities which I took for granted. For instance, our school canteen which sells a variety of food. The pupils in Brunei had to bring their own food to school,” Erin Yasmin, Endurance 1.&nbsp;

  

“I enjoyed myself the most at the Water Village tour. It was my first time taking the boat and visiting a family which resides on the water. We also saw schools built on water too,” Saw Ryan, Endurance 1.

  

“The pupils there are happy and kind. They are also humble and keen to learn despite the limited facilities they have. We should learn to be like them,” Cassandra Koh, Endurance 5.
