<h1>Internationalisation and International Students Programme (IISP)</h1>
<h4></h4>
<p><strong>Internationalisation and International Students Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This committee focuses on 2 programmes; the Internationalisation Programme
and the International Students Programme. The Internationalisation Programme
aims to cultivate global awareness and cultural sensitivity, which strengthen
students' commitment to Singapore while enhancing their cross-cultural
skills. The International Students Programme helps International Students,
Singapore Permanent Residents, and Returning Singaporeans adjust to life
in Singapore while fostering mutual understanding and appreciation of cultural
diversity through meaningful interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>1) To strengthen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.</p>
<p>2) To deepen our students’ 21CC global awareness, cross-cultural skills
and sensitivities.</p>
<p>3) To expose students to Asia, with a greater focus on ASEAN countries,
India and China, and to sensitise them to Singapore’s place in the world.</p>
<p><strong>International Students Programme Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>1) To help International Students (IS), Singapore Permanent Residents
(SPR) and Returning Singaporeans (RS) settle down and adjust to studying
and living in Singapore.</p>
<p>2) To create opportunities for local students and IS/ SPR/ RS to form
friendships based on shared interests and appreciate cultural differences
and diversity.</p>
<p>3) To foster mutual trust, understanding and acceptance among all students
in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, our school collaborated with Ching Chung Hau Po Woon Primary
School in Hong Kong to host a series of virtual sessions. These sessions
allowed students from both countries to connect, share their experiences
and explore the unique aspects of life and culture in each country.</p>

<p><strong>International Students Programme Initiatives</strong>
</p>
<p>1) Buddy System: To ensure a smooth integration of International Students
into the school, a structured approach has been implemented. First, International
Students are identified and paired with designated buddies who will assist
them throughout their transition. These buddies undergo specialised training
to equip them with the necessary skills to effectively support and guide
International Students. Additionally, form teachers collaborate closely
with both International Students and their buddies, providing ongoing support
to enhance a positive and inclusive experience for all involved.</p>
<p>2) Heritage Tour: P3 to P6 International Students participated in the
Duck Tour, visiting various places of interest in Singapore to deepen their
understanding of the nation's history, culture, and heritage.</p>
