Urban Food Warriors is the school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) designed to address issues of sustainability. Especially apt in today’s context, the pandemic has provided a timely reminder of Singapore’s vulnerability in being highly dependent on other countries for our food supply. Pupils will take on the role of understanding the need to ensure and secure a supply of safe food for Singapore, as well as advocating local production as one of the sustainability strategies.  
  

**PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH**  
With the overarching theme of Sustainability, the school’s Total Curriculum Framework (TCF) provide the alignment while Ways of Thinking from the Sustainable Education Framework provide the theoretical underpinnings for ALP Urban Food Warriors.  
CPS TCF serves as a navigational tool to ensure the core aspects of the education of a child are given due consideration when designing key processes and instructional programmes aimed at developing the whole child into a successful individual imbued with the core values and 21st century competencies. The pedagogical approach adopted by the school as stated in CPS TCF is ‘Collaborative Inquiry’ that involves two basic concepts: Collaborative Learning and Inquiry-based learning.  
Meanwhile, the Ways of Thinking from the Sustainable Education Framework serves to provide a conceptual framework to promote thinking routines in the design of our ALP. The four ways of thinking - Futures, Values, Systems and Strategic Thinking - are adapted from Sustainability Science Education (SSE) in Arizona State University, whose work is based on the belief that educators must promote sustainable literacy in the classrooms in order to adequately prepare pupils for the unpredictable world, solve complex challenges and contribute to a more sustainable way of life.  
  



**PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK MAP**   
The table below presents the Pedagogical Framework Map for ALP Urban Food Warriors. To ensure fundamental alignment and seamless integration, the design of ALP Urban Food Warriors draws reference from the 21CC Student Outcomes, school wide approach of Collaborative Inquiry, CPS TCF and Ways Of Thinking.  
ALP Urban Food Warriors will be implemented in phases to ensure effective delivery. P3 &amp; P5 has been implemented in 2021. Followed by P1 &amp; P2 which will be implemented in 2022. Full implementation school-wide will take place by 2023.
