<p>Urban Food Warriors is the school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) designed to address issues of sustainability. Especially apt in today’s
context, the pandemic has provided a timely reminder of Singapore’s vulnerability
in being highly dependent on other countries for our food supply. Pupils
will take on the role of understanding the need to ensure and secure a
supply of safe food for Singapore, as well as advocating local production
as one of the sustainability strategies.</p>
<p><strong>PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH</strong>
<br>With the overarching theme of Sustainability, the school’s Total Curriculum
Framework (TCF) provide the alignment while Ways of Thinking from the Sustainable
Education Framework provide the theoretical underpinnings for ALP Urban
Food Warriors.
<br>CPS TCF serves as a navigational tool to ensure the core aspects of the
education of a child are given due consideration when designing key processes
and instructional programmes aimed at developing the whole child into a
successful individual imbued with the core values and 21st century competencies.
The pedagogical approach adopted by the school as stated in CPS TCF is
‘Collaborative Inquiry’ that involves two basic concepts: Collaborative
Learning and Inquiry-based learning.
<br>Meanwhile, the Ways of Thinking from the Sustainable Education Framework
serves to provide a conceptual framework to promote thinking routines in
the design of our ALP. The four ways of thinking - Futures, Values, Systems
and Strategic Thinking - are adapted from Sustainability Science Education
(SSE) in Arizona State University, whose work is based on the belief that
educators must promote sustainable literacy in the classrooms in order
to adequately prepare pupils for the unpredictable world, solve complex
challenges and contribute to a more sustainable way of life.</p>
<p><strong>PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK MAP</strong>
<br>The table below presents the Pedagogical Framework Map for ALP Urban Food
Warriors. To ensure fundamental alignment and seamless integration, the
design of ALP Urban Food Warriors draws reference from the 21CC Student
Outcomes, school wide approach of Collaborative Inquiry, CPS TCF and Ways
Of Thinking.</p>
