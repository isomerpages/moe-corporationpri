<h1>Internationalisation Programme</h1>
<p>The Internationalisation Programme aims to foster global awareness and
cultural sensitivity among students, strengthening their commitment to
Singapore while enhancing their cross-cultural competencies.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme Activities</strong></h3>
<p>In 2025, our school continued to strengthen global ties through two key
internationalisation initiatives; hosting visiting students and educators
from our overseas partner schools and embarking on an overseas learning
journey to Japan.</p>
<p><strong>1) Hosting Visiting Students from Hong Kong</strong>
</p>
<p>On 3 April 2025, our school welcomed 40 Primary 6 students and 4 teachers
from WF Joseph Lee Primary School, Hong Kong, for a cultural immersion
visit. The visitors took part in an engaging STEM classroom activity and
enjoyed a guided tour of our school. The exchange fostered meaningful interactions
between students from both schools and deepened cross-cultural understanding.</p>
<p>As part of the ongoing partnership, Corporation Primary School will be
visiting WF Joseph Lee Primary School in 2026, continuing this valuable
exchange of learning experiences.</p>

<p><strong>2) Overseas Immersion Trip to Japan</strong>
</p>
<p>From 27 to 31 May 2025, 15 Primary 5 students and 3 teachers participated
in an Overseas Learning Journey to Tokyo and Sendai, Japan. During the
trip, students explored cultural and historical landmarks, gaining hands-on
insights into Japanese culture, lifestyle, and agriculture through interactive
and experiential activities.</p>
<p>The group also visited Waseda Jitsugyo Elementary School (Tokyo) and St.
Ursula Eichi Academy (Sendai), where students engaged in collaborative
learning and cultural exchange activities. These experiences not only broadened
their global perspectives but also nurtured leadership, teamwork, and confidence
through shared challenges and meaningful interactions with their Japanese
peers. The students also learnt the importance of being adaptable and demonstrated
adaptability as they navigated new environments and cultural experiences.</p>
<p>As a post-OLJ activity, the students had the opportunity to share their
experiences and learning with both teachers and the whole school community
during a special assembly session. Their reflections and presentations
have inspired their peers to be curious about other cultures and to embrace
learning beyond the classroom.</p>
