<h1>Internationalisation Programme</h1>
<p>The Internationalisation Programme aims to foster global awareness and
cultural sensitivity among students, strengthening their commitment to
Singapore while enhancing their cross-cultural competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>1. To deepen students’ sense of commitment and connection to Singapore.</p>
<p>2. To develop students' 21st-century competencies (21CC), specifically
in global awareness, cross-cultural skills, and cultural sensitivities.</p>
<p>3. To provide students with exposure to different parts of Asia, with
a focus on ASEAN countries, helping them understand Singapore’s role in
the global landscape.</p>
