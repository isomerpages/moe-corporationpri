<h3><strong>SCIENCE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK AND VISION FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION</strong></h3>
<p>Corporation Primary School aligns itself closely to the revised Science
Curriculum Framework, as shown below, to provide students with strong fundamentals
in Science for life, learning, citizenry and work.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/science.png">
</div>
<p>Our vision for Science education, manifested through the&nbsp;<strong>three `Ins’</strong>,
encapsulates the overall experience of our students in Science education:</p>
<p><strong>a. Inspired by Science.</strong>&nbsp;Students enjoy learning
Science, and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections
and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard
Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciate how Science and Technology
have transformed the world and improved our lives. Students are open to
the possibility of pursuing Science-related careers to serve the good of
society.</p>
<p><strong>b. Inquire like Scientists.</strong>&nbsp;Students have strong
fundamentals in Science, and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry.
They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded
in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played
by Science in daily life, society and the environment. They can discern,
weigh alternatives and evaluate claims and ideas critically, based on logical
scientific evidence and arguments, and yet are able to suspend judgement
where there is lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>c. Innovate using Science.</strong>&nbsp;Students apply Science
to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from
those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity.
It is envisaged that there will be a strong pipeline of students who can
contribute towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise.</p>
<h3><strong>SCIENCE PROGRAMMES</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>TIER 1: For all pupils - Developing Interest and Competency in Science</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lower Primary Infusion&nbsp; (P1 &amp; P2)</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils are innately curious about the world around them. And though they
may not realise it, they are applying Science concepts every day. So although
Science is not formally a subject taught at Primary 1 &amp; 2, there are
ample opportunities to infuse Science in their lessons and to develop their
interests in Science. For instance, to bring their learning to life, pupils
had hands-on activities with Magnets after reading a Stellar Text on Magnetic
Max.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Experimental Investigation and Scientific Inquiry (P3 to P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>To strengthen understanding of scientific concepts, pupils have opportunities
to conduct hands-on activities as part of experimental investigation and
scientific inquiry. This is necessary for them to be able to design fair
and reliable tests underpinned by a solid grasp of key process skills such
as determining changed/constant/measured variables, identifying aim of
experiment, forming hypothesis and stating conclusion.</p>

<h5><strong>TIER 2: Developing Science Talents and STEM Champions</strong></h5>
<p><strong>STEM Playground Challenges [Open to all]</strong>
</p>
<p>In partnership with Science Centre Singapore and Dyson Foundation, STEM
Playground Challenges are open to all students, providing an exciting opportunity
for them to explore Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
through hands-on activities and problem-solving tasks. These challenges
are designed to spark curiosity, creativity, and innovation in a fun and
engaging environment. Students will collaborate, experiment, and apply
their knowledge to tackle real-world challenges, fostering critical thinking
and resilience. Through participation, they develop a deeper appreciation
for STEM while building confidence in their abilities. We encourage all
students to take part and discover the joy of learning through exploration!</p>

<p><strong>Primary 5 Science Stretch Programme [For selected pupils]</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Science Stretch Programme is designed for selected Primary 5 students
who demonstrate a strong interest and aptitude in Science. This enrichment
programme on Thursday afternoons provides opportunities for students to
engage in hands-on investigations, critical thinking activities, and advanced
scientific explorations beyond the standard curriculum. Through inquiry-based
learning and real-world applications, students will deepen their scientific
understanding and develop essential problem-solving skills. The programme
aims to nurture curiosity, innovation, and a passion for Science, preparing
students for higher-level scientific inquiry in the future.</p>
<p><strong>External Science Competitions or Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>To extend learning beyond the classroom, selected students have the opportunity
to participate in external Science competitions and enrichment programmes.
These events provide a platform for students to apply their scientific
knowledge, hone their critical thinking skills, and engage with like-minded
peers. Participation is by invitation and based on specific criteria such
as academic performance, enthusiasm for Science, and problem-solving abilities.
The school also provides support for students who show potential but may
face financial constraints, ensuring that all deserving students have the
opportunity to benefit from these enriching experiences. Through these
experiences, students gain valuable exposure to advanced scientific concepts
and real-world applications, further nurturing their passion for Science.</p>
