<h3><strong>SCIENCE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK AND VISION FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION</strong></h3>
<p>Corporation Primary School aligns itself closely to the revised Science
Curriculum Framework, as shown below, to provide students with strong fundamentals
in Science for life, learning, citizenry and work.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/science.png">
</div>
<p>Our vision for Science education, manifested through the&nbsp;<strong>three `Ins’</strong>,
encapsulates the overall experience of our students in Science education:</p>
<p><strong>a. Inspired by Science.</strong>&nbsp;Students enjoy learning
Science, and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections
and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard
Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciate how Science and Technology
have transformed the world and improved our lives. Students are open to
the possibility of pursuing Science-related careers to serve the good of
society.</p>
<p><strong>b. Inquire like Scientists.</strong>&nbsp;Students have strong
fundamentals in Science, and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry.
They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded
in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played
by Science in daily life, society and the environment. They can discern,
weigh alternatives and evaluate claims and ideas critically, based on logical
scientific evidence and arguments, and yet are able to suspend judgement
where there is lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>c. Innovate using Science.</strong>&nbsp;Students apply Science
to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from
those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity.
It is envisaged that there will be a strong pipeline of students who can
contribute towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise.</p>
<h3><strong>SCIENCE PROGRAMMES</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>TIER 1: For all pupils - Developing Interest and Competency in Science</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lower Primary Infusion&nbsp; (P1 &amp; P2)</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils are innately curious about the world around them. And though they
may not realise it, they are applying Science concepts every day. So although
Science is not formally a subject taught at Primary 1 &amp; 2, there are
ample opportunities to infuse Science in their lessons and to develop their
interests in Science. For instance, to bring their learning to life, pupils
had hands-on activities with Magnets after reading a Stellar Text on Magnetic
Max.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Experimental Investigation and Scientific Inquiry (P3 to P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>To strengthen understanding of scientific concepts, pupils have opportunities
to conduct hands-on activities as part of experimental investigation and
scientific inquiry. This is necessary for them to be able to design fair
and reliable tests underpinned by a solid grasp of key process skills such
as determining changed/constant/measured variables, identifying aim of
experiment, forming hypothesis and stating conclusion.</p>

<h5><strong>TIER 2: For selected pupils – Developing Science Talents and STEM Champions</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme (launched in 2021)</strong>
</p>
<p>E2K Science Programme Singapore is a Science enrichment programme for
Primary 5 pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Science.</p>
<p>Only teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run E2K Science
Programme that engages pupils in scientific investigations involving advanced
science concepts. It aims to engage pupils in scientific inquiry that will
help them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists
possess as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as
critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>External Science Competitions &amp; Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils who display the aptitude, commitment, talent and excellence are
selected by the school to participate in external Science Competitions
and programmes organized by other schools. Eg. Da Vinci Junior &amp; Mcurie
Programme by NUS High and Abbott Young Scientist Awards by Science Centre
Singapore. The school also provides support if the pupil decides to take
part in other related Science competitions such as Singapore Science Buskers
(organized by Science Centre Singapore).</p>
<p><strong>Urban STEM Champions</strong>
</p>
<p>Urban STEM Champions Programme aims to provide selected P4 students, as
identified through a rigorous process, with the opportunity to make connections
across subject disciplines to solve authentic problems relating to environmental
sustainability. With this avenue provided, students work collaboratively
to build, programme, code with logical and analytical skills and present
their own prototypes while learning key aspects of STEM – Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math. With the various hands-on experimentation using STEM
kits, students will be able to explore environmental sustainability issues
with greater depth and have more outreach to school and community.</p>
