Corporation Primary School firmly believes that every child is an unique individual. In line with the school mission to provide a holistic education to nurture and inspire each individual through continuous learning in a happy environment, special programmes are introduced to further develop each child academically and in character.

  

From the schoolâ€™s special programmes, pupils have the opportunity to learn and share beyond the classroom. They are further equipped with the essential skills as well as attitudes and values that are needed to develop them into life-long learners with a passion for learning and a passion for living. As such, we hope to nurture our pupils holistically in a natural and authentic learning environment, thus developing them into thinking and responsible individuals who will contribute to the society.
