<h1>Departments</h1>
<p>Corporation Primary School firmly believes that every child is an unique
individual. In line with the school mission to nurture character and a
passion for lifelong learning in a supportive environment, special programmes
are introduced to further develop each child in character and academically.</p>
<p>From the schoolâ€™s special programmes, pupils have the opportunity to learn
and share beyond the classroom. They are further equipped with the essential
skills as well as attitudes and values that are needed to develop them
into life-long learners with a passion for learning and a passion for living.
As such, we hope to nurture our pupils holistically in a natural and authentic
learning environment, thus developing them into thinking and responsible
individuals who will contribute to the society.</p>
