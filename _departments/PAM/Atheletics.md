Athletics
=========
The athletics component involves students primarily in running, jumping and throwing activities that promote both personal striving and comparison. Athletics is taught from Primary 3 onwards where the basic actions of running, jumping and throwing acquired at Primary 1 and 2 are transferred and developed to more specialised skills.Â 

  

These multiple learning contexts will be presented for students to learn to be determined and resilient, as they developed their potential and apply them in our yearly sports carnival.
