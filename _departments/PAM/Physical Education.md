**PE Vision in CPS**: We seek to enable students to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.  

  

In 2014, a new 2014 PE syllabus was introduced using Learning Outcomes (LOs) to specify minimally what students should know and be able to do as a result of their learning.   

  

The Primary PE syllabus aims to develop competent movers who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies.
