**SYF Art Exhibition 2021**

This year's SYF Art Exhibition celebrates the artist in every student and promotes appreciation for the arts. Themed 'Artist and Technology', the exhibition invited student artists to reflect on how technology has impacted their lives. Over 3,500 students submitted more than 500 artworks via a range of media as artistic and creative responses to the theme. Through their artworks, many students emphasised the importance of safe and responsible usage of technology. The SYF Art Exhibition will be showcased online via the SYF website from 3 July to 31 December.

  

Selected P2 students from CPS learned to use iPad and Stopmotion app to present their ideas for their artwork and even won the Special Mention award! Well done pupils!

**Art Education in CPS**    
Art captures memories, communicates ideas, shapes values and evokes emotions. In a world where we are surrounded by different forms of visual imagery, Art is a language that allows us to communicate and learn more about ourselves, others and the world around us. As an academic subject, Art plays an integral role in students’ holistic development.
