S.O.A.R in CPS
==============

**S**oaring through  
**O**pportunities & Creating   
**A**wareness in a   
**R**eflective & fun environment 

  

The Primary 1 pupils learn that school is an exciting and engaging place for learning through S.O.A.R in Term 1. 

  

Primary 2 pupils experience S.O.A.R 2.0 in Term 1. 

  

To support their holistic development, CPS focuses on identifying their prior experiences and bridging their skills through the following modules: 

1. Listening and Speaking 

2. Financial Literacy 

3. Decision Making
4. ICT 


CPS pupils are often given opportunities to participate in group work to encourage them to engage in discussions and understand the value of teamwork. 

  

These experiences are building blocks to help Primary 1 pupils transit to formal learning. Through the various modules, teachers ensure that these experiences are effectively integrated into the curriculum to ensure a seamless transition. 

  

S.O.A.R provides opportunities to deepen teacher-student relationships and 

peer relationships in school. Schools play both a passive and active role in fostering relationships through discussions. Through games, discussions and hands-on tasks, pupils learn the concept of money to purchase food in the canteen. In terms of social development, S.O.A.R prepares them for group work.

  

The modules are in-depth and cover a wide spectrum (eg. P1 ICT lessons, pupils learn to log in and learn the basic features  of laptop/ computer while in P2  they learn some basic features of Word Document 

  

P1 focuses on self (discipline, self- awareness, self-management) 

P2 focuses on self and others (social awareness, relationship management)

Outdoor Education Module

Outdoor Education module aims at providing pupils with orienteering skills, giving pupils the opportunity to be immersed in nature and appreciating the wonders of nature. They also learn the usefulness of plants and animals around them. We foster our pupils’ self-awareness on their strengths, weaknesses and to embrace themselves as unique individuals.
