Sports and Games
================

  

Â For Sports & Games module, our Primary 2 pupils develop their confidence and enjoy many individual and group experiences. We have specially crafted lessons that expose pupils to a broad range of sports skills and games. As they learn new skills in sports, they also work in teams to overcome the many challenges and obstacles posed in the games. After each game, our pupils are given an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings. They use the time provided to reflect on their teamwork, strategies and to make responsible decisions.
