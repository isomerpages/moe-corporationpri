Performing Arts
===============

Performing Arts in CPS falls under our Lifelong Learning Programme - Nurturing Talent and Creativity Through Dance. The aim of this module is for pupils to express themselves creatively through movement and dance. The module serves to encourage spontaneity and stimulates the aesthetic sensitivity in each child. The pupils in Primary 1 are taught the basic dance movements, concepts of personal space and are allowed to freely express themselves with the use of creative movement skills. Pupils are encouraged to create their own movements and these are incorporated into their final dance performance, giving them a sense of ownership. Lessons are progressive in nature with Primary 2 learning a more advanced creative movement skills.
