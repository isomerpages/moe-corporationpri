Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
===================================

#### Objectives

• To provide pupils with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in Outdoor Education, Sports & Games, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.  
• To facilitate the well-rounded development of pupils in the 5 learning domains (physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral)   
• To provide varied avenues for pupils to develop social emotional competencies.

The planning of PAL in CPS started in 2009 and it was rolled out in 2010 to all the Primary 1 to Primary 2 classes.

PAL comes in 4 modules namely, Outdoor Education, Sports & Games, Performing Arts & Visual Arts. CPS has also introduced a new PAL module, S.O.A.R in CPS which pupils experience in Term 1. 

#### Desired outcomes

Our lessons are carefully prepared and planned with specific desired outcomes. Through PAL, we hope to nurture and develop pupils who are:

• CR3 : Confident, Responsible, Reflective problem-solvers, Resilient  
• RICHER in values 
• Competent in all the Socio-emotional domains.

The lessons are crafted to be experiential and exploratory in nature. David Kolb’s (1984) Experiential Learning Cycle forms the foundation of our lessons across all four modules.

The exploratory and experiential nature of lessons allows pupils to be self-directed learners. Pupils drive their own learning by making responsible decisions, reflecting on their decisions, and implementing new thoughts and ideas.

Final Note  
The activities in PAL enable pupils to exhibit confidence and enjoy individual and group experiences. They are provided with the platforms to connect ideas and express themselves creatively as well as explore and extend knowledge and skills learnt to their daily lives.
