#### Making Chinese Language a Living Language



No two students are alike. Today, as more Chinese students entering Primary 1 speak predominantly English at home, the Chinese Language curriculum must adapt itself to offer greater flexibility in its teaching and learning. Those who exhibit mastery can advance and those who need reinforcement can move forward when they are ready.


  

The CL curriculum makes CL learning an enjoyable experience and encourages children to learn the language to the highest level. The school hopes to help your child develop an abiding interest in learning CL, so that he or she will continue to use it as a living language after they leave school.


**Teaching Approach**


The Chinese Department works towards making Chinese Language learning enjoyable through adopting the inquiry-based approach:


  

Pupils are encouraged to explore, ask questions, and share ideas which will foster their curiosity and ownership in learning. Pupils will also develop the critical thinking and communication skills through this form of active learning. Ultimately, we want our pupils to develop the love for exploration and learning.

Pupils will benefit from the teaching approach based on these guiding principles:

**Chinese Language Programmes**  

**1. Structured Reading Programme (SRP)**

This is a P1-P5 school-based curriculum aimed at promoting a reading culture among the pupils. Under this programme, P1-5 pupils will read about a total of 50-60 age-appropriate Readers throughout their years in the school. To promote the love for reading among our young learners at P1 & P2, curriculum time is set aside for CL teachers to guide pupils in the reading and appreciation of stories during their reading period every week. After reading, pupils will be engaged with activities such as bookmark designing, reading aloud and role playing to deepen their learning. We want our pupils to enjoy reading form young.

  

**2. Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)**

As one of the initiatives by the Committee to promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) aims to expose pupils to Chinese Language related cultural performance to enhance their learning. Since 2006, our P2-P4 pupils have the opportunity to watch and appreciate drama performances in the theatres. The following are some of the performances that our pupils had watched over the years: The Three Billy Goat Gruff （三只山羊）, Journey to the West (西游记之火焰山), Al （爱丽丝梦游仙境）, Ugly Ducking（丑小鸭）.

  

**3. MTL Fortnight Learning Fest (CL)**

To create a conducive environment to promote MTL usage and learning outside MTL classrooms, our school organizes Mother Tongue Language Fortnights and language & cultural camps annually. The MTL Fortnight activities provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so as to experience MTL as ‘living languages’.

**10. Festival Celebrations**

To nurture our pupils to be culturally savvy, the department will celebrate the various festivals (CNY, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali) every year. The Chinese department celebrates traditional festivals such as Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. Through the celebrations, pupils will understand more about the festivals and learn to be appreciative towards other cultures which will bring about racial integration.
