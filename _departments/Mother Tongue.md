<h1>Mother Tongue</h1><p><strong>Vision</strong>: Nurture our pupils to be confident users of MTL &amp; be culturally savvy.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong>:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To provide a conducive environment for pupils to learn and use the language actively &amp; confidently.</p></li><li><p>To inculcate the values in our pupils and nurture them to be gracious citizens.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Department Focus</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Department%20Focus.png"></div><h3><strong>Chinese Department</strong></h3><p><strong>Chinese Language Curriculum</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:150px;height:120px;margin-left:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Happy Learning.png"></div><p>#### Making Chinese Language&nbsp;a Living Language</p><p>No two students are alike. Today, as more Chinese students entering Primary 1 speak predominantly English at home, the Chinese Language curriculum must adapt itself to offer greater flexibility in its teaching and learning. Those who exhibit mastery can advance and those who need reinforcement can move forward when they are ready.</p><p>The CL curriculum makes CL learning an enjoyable experience and encourages children to learn the language to best of their ability. The school hopes to help your child develop an abiding interest in learning CL, so that he or she will continue to use it as a living language after they leave school.</p><p><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p><p>The Chinese Department works towards making Chinese Language learning enjoyable through adopting the inquiry-based approach:</p><p>Pupils are encouraged to explore, ask questions, and share ideas which will foster their curiosity and ownership in learning. Pupils will also develop the critical thinking and communication skills through this form of active learning. Ultimately, we want our pupils to develop the love for exploration and learning.</p><p>Pupils will benefit from the teaching approach based on these guiding principles:</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DEPARTMENT_MT_CL_TEACHING%20APPROACH_guiding%20principles.png"></div><p><strong>Chinese Language Programmes</strong></p><p><strong>1. Structured Reading Programme (SRP)</strong></p><p>This is a P1-P5 school-based curriculum aimed at promoting the love for reading among the pupils. P1-5 pupils will read a total of 50-60 age-appropriate Readers throughout their years in the school. CL teachers will set aside time during curriculum to guide pupils in the reading and appreciation of stories. To promote the love for reading among our young learners at P1 &amp; P2, the use of the e-reading portal (Dudutown) was implemented in 2022. The young learners are more motivated to read the e-books and watch the videos using the platform. Under the Reading Passport Programme, parents are also strongly encouraged to read together with their P1 &amp; P2 children and complete the activities such as bookmark making and reflection log. Through all these activities, we hope to cultivate the love for reading among our pupils!</p><p><strong>2. Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong></p><p>As one of the initiatives by the Committee to promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) aims to expose pupils to Chinese Language related cultural performance to enhance their learning. Since 2006, our P2-P5 pupils have watched and appreciated drama performances in the theatres. The following are some of the performances that our pupils had watched over the years: The Three Billy Goat Gruff （三只山羊）, Journey to the West (西游记之火焰山), Al （爱丽丝梦游仙境）, Ugly Ducking（丑小鸭）.</p><p><strong>3. MTL Fortnight Learning Fest (CL)</strong> To create a conducive environment to promote MTL usage and learning outside classrooms, our school organizes Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Learning Fest annually. The MTL Fortnight activities provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated cultures so as to experience MTL as 'living languages'.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DEPARTMENT_MT_CL_MTL%20Fortnight%20Learning%20Fest%20(CL).png"></div><p><strong>4.Cultural Appreciation Programme</strong></p><p>Under our Cultural Appreciation Programme, pupils experience the different types of cultural workshops within their six years of education in school.
