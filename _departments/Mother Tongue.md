where teachers guide them in selecting suitable books.</p>

by providing interactive reading experiences. Additionally, book fairs
will be arranged, giving students the opportunity to explore and select
books that captivate their interest. Through these initiatives, we aspire
to cultivate a vibrant reading culture and instill a lifelong passion for
reading in our students!</p>
