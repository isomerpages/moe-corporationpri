<p>CCE lessons in school comprise CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period), or
CCE (FTGP), CCE (Mother Tongue Language), or CCE (MTL), and Programme for
Active Learning (PAL) at lower primary.</p>
<p>The Social Studies (SS) curriculum complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing
citizenship dispositions. During SS lessons, students learn and understand
what it means to be a citizen of a country and the world.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Our CCE Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>CCE Ambassadors</strong> are selected in each Primary 1 to Primary
6 class. They are chosen based on good character and can be a positive
role model to their classmates and schoolmates. CCE Ambassadors are responsible
for managing the Appreciation Corner in their classes, where they lead
the effort to write gratitude notes to one another and inspire their classmates
to do the same. They also organise and take charge of monthly birthday
celebrations within their classes.</p>
<p>The P4 to P6 CCE Ambassadors may be tasked to support the 4 National Education
events by promoting awareness and engagement within their classes, as well
as assisting teachers with the implementation of activities during recess.
They also play a role in advocating the school values through assembly
programmes. Additionally, the P4 to P6 CCE Ambassadors guide the younger
P1 to P3 CCE Ambassadors in fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>In The Know</strong> is a monthly sharing during pre-assembly on
newspaper articles related to our RICHER values and contemporary issues.
Interesting occupations that are relevant in the 21st century are also
shared to allow our students to explore different career paths and gain
insights on possibilities in their education pathways. This programme aims
to spark the students’ curiosity and develop them to be self-directed lifelong
learners.</p>

<p><strong>Values-based Lessons</strong> conducted during Form Teacher (FT)
Time aim to teach our P1 to P3 students the school’s RICHER values explicitly.
The RICHER values are taught through stories which help our students to
understand ways to demonstrate the values. P1 values-based lessons focus
on understanding of the values and sharing of personal experiences while
P2 and P3 values-based lessons focus on commitment of students to display
the values through their actions.</p>

good deeds out of their own initiative. Students who obtain milestones

<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong> is one of the six
curriculum content areas in CCE.</p>
<p>The goals of ECG are to support students in:</p>
<p>a) Discovering Purpose – Who am I?: Nurture students’ self-awareness to
support them in discovering how they can meaningfully play a part in their
community.</p>
<p>b) Exploring Opportunities – Where do I want to go?: Develop students’
self-directedness and confidence to explore and leverage education and
career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations.</p>
<p>c) Staying Relevant – How do I get there?: Build students’ adaptability
and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>The <strong>P6 ECG Aspiration Programme</strong> is an annual programme
for P6 students as part of their post-PSLE activities. Students across
classes are grouped based on their preferences from a selection of industries.
Throughout the programme, they participate in industry-specific activities
and attend informative talks by teachers and alumni, which offer insights
on the various fields. Students then apply their learning and showcase
their work during the P6 Graduation Day.</p>

<p>The P6 students also participate in the annual Secondary Road Show to
learn about the programmes offered by secondary schools in the west. Prior
to the event, during FTGP lessons, students use the MySkillsFuture student
portal to explore potential education pathways. They also carefully consider
various factors, such as the CCAs and special programmes available at different
schools, enabling them to make informed decisions when selecting a secondary
school.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> is a learning experience in Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as
socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contributions
to the community. In Corporation Primary School, students are given an
opportunity to choose and have a voice in what they believe will make a
difference in the community. This is in line with our school’s philosophy
that CPS students can contribute to the society in his/her individual capacity.
Through VIA, students will be able to exercise social responsibility in
their spheres of influence and play their part through meaningful contribution
to the community.</p>
