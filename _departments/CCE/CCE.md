<p>CCE lessons in school comprise CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period), or
CCE (FTGP), CCE (Mother Tongue Language), or CCE (MTL), and Programme for
Active Learning (PAL) at lower primary.</p>
<p>The Social Studies (SS) curriculum complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing
citizenship dispositions. During SS lessons, students learn and understand
what it means to be a citizen of a country and the world.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Our CCE Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>CCE Ambassadors</strong> are selected in each Primary 1 to Primary
6 class, who are chosen based on good character and can be a positive role
model to their classmates and schoolmates. CCE Ambassadors take charge
of the Appreciation Corner and Monthly Birthday Celebrations in their classes.</p>
<p>For the P4 to P6 CCE Ambassadors, they may be tasked to provide assistance
to the 4 National Education events, such as increasing awareness and engagement
in their respective classes and assisting teachers in implementation of
activities during their lunch periods. The P4 to P6 CCE Ambassadors also
provide guidance to the younger P1 to P3 CCE Ambassadors in carrying out
their responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In The Know</strong> is a monthly sharing during pre-assembly on
newspaper articles related to our RICHER values and contemporary issues.
Interesting occupations that are relevant in the 21st century are also
shared to allow our students to explore different career paths and gain
insights on possibilities in their education pathways. This programme aims
to spark the students’ curiosity and develop our students to be self-directed
lifelong learners.</p>

<p><strong>Values-based Lessons</strong> conducted during FT Time aim to teach
our P1 to P3 students the school’s RICHER values explicitly. The RICHER
values are taught through stories which help our students to understand
ways to demonstrate the values. P1 values-based lessons focus on understanding
of the values and sharing of personal experiences while P2 and P3 values-based
lessons focus on commitment of students to display the values through their
actions.</p>

<p><strong>Values Inculcation Programme (VIP) </strong>aims to encourage
our students to display the RICHER values through their words and deeds.
For our P1 and P2 students, stickers are awarded when they are seen doing
good deeds out of their own initiative. Students who obtain milestones
of 10, 40, 80 or 100 stars will receive a token and/or a certificate of
commendation.</p>

<p><strong>RICHER Award</strong> aims to recognise our P3 to P6 students who
demonstrate our RICHER values consistently through their actions and deeds.
It is awarded at the end of Semester 1 to a student from each P3 to P6

demonstrated by the awardees are also conveyed to the school as good examples
for other students to learn the various ways in demonstrating the school’s
RICHER values.</p>

<p>CPS creates <strong>National Education</strong> experiences through the
4 commemorative events – Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day,
Racial Harmony Day and National Day. These 4 commemorative events mark
important points in Singapore’s history. A variety of activities are planned
for these 4 events, including assembly programmes and activity booths during

<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong> is one of the six
curriculum content areas in CCE. Students are provided opportunities to
explore interesting occupations relevant in the 21st century and explore
various education pathways. ECG is infused into the P5 and P6 FTGP curriculum
for students to explore the MySkillsFuture student portal during FTGP lessons
and at home.</p>
<p>In 2023, <strong>P4 Career Conversations</strong> was piloted for the P4
students to have conversations with working professionals to find out more
about their occupations and industries. The school invited working professionals
to introduce and explain more about their jobs, what they do daily, and
the education pathways required to acquire the jobs. The students asked
questions to discover more about the different occupations and were exposed
to a variety of industries.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> is a learning experience in Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as
socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contributions
to the community. In Corporation Primary School, students are given an
opportunity to choose and have a voice in what they believe will make a
difference in the community. This is in line with our school’s philosophy
that CPS students can contribute to the society in his/her individual capacity.
Through VIA, students will be able to exercise social responsibility in
their spheres of influence and play their part through meaningful contribution
to the community.</p>
