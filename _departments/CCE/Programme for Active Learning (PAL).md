<h1>Character and Citizenship Education – Programme for Active Learning</h1>
<p>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is part of the Character and Citizenship
(CCE) curriculum for all Primary 1 and Primary 2 students. It offers hands-on
and experiential learning through the domains of Sports and Games, Outdoor
Education, Visual Arts and Performing Arts. Students engage in authentic
and active learning experiences during PAL lessons. PAL also provides opportunities
for students to explore and discover their interests, build character,
and develop social-emotional competencies.</p>
<p>In line with the CCE 2021 curriculum frame, PAL lessons are designed to
achieve specific CCE Learning Outcomes (LO) identified for each level.</p>

<p>Students are given numerous opportunities to develop their social-emotional
competencies by expressing their thoughts and feelings during PAL lessons.
They are guided to reflect on what they have learnt for each lesson.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mindfulness</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2021, mindfulness activities have been infused in PAL lessons. Practising
mindfulness helps pupils to focus better and be more self-aware of their
own thoughts and emotions. Students are introduced to a variety of simple
mindfulness activities and are given opportunities to practise them during
PAL lessons. Students with leadership qualities are also selected as Mindful
Ambassadors to lead their peers in doing the mindfulness activities as
a class.</p>
<p><strong><u>PAL curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The PAL curriculum encompasses four domains: <strong>Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts</strong> and <strong>Performing Arts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Sports and Games</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are provided with both individual and group experiences in Sports
and Games. They are exposed to a broad range of sport skills and games
and are given opportunities to develop their confidence in completing various
physical tasks. Students work in teams to overcome challenges posed in
the games and learn the importance of playing safely and fairly.</p>

<p><strong>2. Outdoor Education</strong>
</p>
<p>For Outdoor Education, students learn and appreciate the elements of nature,
such as the usefulness of plants and animals around them and how human
actions can impact the nature. Through the lessons, other than practising
social awareness and responsibility, the students also learn and practise
skills such as map-reading and using directional signs to navigate their
way.</p>
<p>Outdoor Education in CPS is also tied in with the school’s Applied Learning
Programme (ALP), with the theme Water Conservation for Primary 1 and Marine
Conservation for Primary 2.</p>

<p><strong>3. Visual Arts</strong>
</p>
<p>In Visual Arts, students learn and use the different mediums in art to
express themselves while also learning about personal space and working
with others. Students are also given opportunities to be creative, such
as designing menus, advertisements and the interior of cafés.</p>

<p><strong>4. Performing Arts</strong>
</p>
<p>Performing Arts in CPS falls under our Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP)
- Nurturing Talent and Creativity through Dance. Students learn how they
can express themselves creatively with different parts of their body through
movement (creative movement). Students learn to be more aware and confident
about their body, building their self-awareness and self-discipline. They
learn and dance to our very own CPS Dance and are given opportunities to
create their own moves.</p>
