Peer Support and Relationships
==================================
  

 
**PURPOSE OF PSR**

In line with the CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework, our school has established a Peer Support Relationship (PSR) structure. PSR is critical for building a caring and enabling school environment. 

Having strong PSR helps our students feel more connected to others. This sense of relatedness goes a long way in increasing their motivation to attend school. As students learn to look out for one another, PSR also serves as an extra layer of safety net for our children when they require help.

**3 Domains of PSR**

1. Peer Bonding 
2. Peer Helping 
3. Peer Influencing


**2 Tiers of Implementation for PSR**

* Tier 1 programmes are for all students. Every student can be a peer supporter with explicit teaching of basic PSR knowledge and skills, and provision of opportunities for students to demonstrate PSR.
* Tier 2 programmes are for selected Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs make up one of the main student leadership bodies in our school. These leaders undergo specialized training to become more adept at skills required for all three PSR domains.

**Tier 1 Programmes**

* Develop class sociograms to help Form Teachers better understand the peer relationship dynamics in their class.

* Promote peer bonding in class through ACE.
	* Appreciate: Students share appreciation notes to one another.
	* Celebrate: Students celebrate birthdays of classmates.
	* Express: Students are given opportunities to express themselves in class. 

**Tier 2 Programmes**

PSLs apply their specialized knowledge on PSR by creating a video based on the theme of “Kindness Boomerang”. The video serves to encourage their peers to display and pass on acts of kindness to each other.
