### OUR SCHOOLS, OUR STORIES 2022

Mdm Anomâ€™s photo story featuring P3 ALP Urban Food Warriors has won the Best Photo Story among the hundreds of other submissions under Our School Community Category by MOE Staff. Although only 8 photos from the P3 level could be featured, we would like to thank all the teachers involved for all the hard work and effort bringing pupils through the multidisciplinary lessons and making learning meaningful by contributing to the community.
