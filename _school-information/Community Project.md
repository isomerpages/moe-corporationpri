CPS Mozzie Wipeout Video!
-------------------------

  
Singapore is facing an alarming rise in dengue cases and collective community action needs to be taken in order to stop the outbreak from escalating. With a short breeding cycle of seven days, keeping the mosquito population in check requires the collective efforts of everyone to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats. Homeowners and occupants must pay attention to any mosquito breeding or adult mosquitoes present in homes, along corridors and within compounds, and take the necessary steps to prevent or remove them.  
  
One very effective way of doing this is through the&nbsp;**Mozzie Wipeout**. The instructional video below is done by our pupil, Ng Yu Thung, an awardee for the Hong Kah North Green Scholarship 2019.

Let us all do our part in Defending Ourselves Against Dengue!
