<h2>Morning Reporting Time</h2>
<p>Morning activities are planned for students from 7.30 a.m. to 7.45 a.m.
They include fitness activities, prize-giving, presentations, briefings,
and attire checks, to name a few. As such, students are expected to be
at the assembly venue from 7.30 a.m. every morning.</p>
<p>Should a student need to eat his / her breakfast in school, they may do
so before 7.25 a.m.. If a student reaches school after 7.25 a.m. (Mon –
Thu), they may still buy their breakfast from the School Canteen to be
packed and consumed during Snack Time and should promptly make their way
to the assembly venue after buying their food.</p>
<p>All students are required to be present when the National Anthem is sung
and the National Pledge is taken. As such, students will not be allowed
to buy food from 7.40 a.m. (Mon – Thu) or 7.25 a.m. (Fri). All students
should also be in school no later than 7.40 a.m. (Mon – Thu) or 7.25 a.m.
(Fri) in order to reach the assembly venue by 7.45 a.m. (Mon – Thu) or
7.30 a.m. (Fri).</p>
<p>Parents should remind their children about the importance of punctuality
and assist in planning his / her travel time to take into consideration
possible delays such as traffic jams. Students will receive warning letters
if they are persistently late after several reminders are given.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h2>Illness and Absence from School</h2>
<p>Students must attend school regularly and punctually so as not to miss
any lesson and be at a disadvantage. However, a student should not attend
school when he / she is ill. Parents / Guardians should inform the form
teacher and ensure the absence is covered by a doctor’s medical certificate
(MC) or letter*. Parents / Guardians may submit MCs and letters either
in hardcopy or through Parents Gateway. When a student falls ill while
in school, only the parent / guardian will be allowed to take him / her
home.</p>
<p><em>*The number of letters accepted will be limited to 5 per semester, and each letter should cover no more than 2 days. If a student exceeds the accepted number of letters per semester, subsequent absences will be taken as invalid absences, which will affect his / her conduct grade.</em>
</p>
<p>Absence from school without a valid reason is a school offence. Non-valid
reasons include oversleeping and willful absence from school. Travelling
during term time is generally not considered a valid reason for absence.
Parents / Guardians who wish to take their children / wards overseas for
vacation and / or to attend to personal matters should do so during the
school holidays. Should there be any urgent need to travel, parents are
requested to submit the request via Parents Gateway with the reason clearly
stated.</p>
<p>On the day of a student’s absence, the form teacher will contact the parents
/ guardian to check on the student. If a student is absent frequently,
the form teacher or other school personnel may conduct a home visit. Should
there be no improvement in the student’s attendance, his / her parents
/ guardian will be requested to meet the principal for a discussion.</p>

<h2>Policy On The Use Of The Internet</h2>
<p>Corporation Primary School is well equipped with devices such as computers
and iPads in the computer laboratories. Devices are used as a tool in teaching
and learning with the aim to facilitate learning through the use of information
technology.</p>
<p>The Internet is an extremely rich resource both for learning and for interaction.
We encourage students to make effective use of the rich information and
resources available on the Internet both for study and for interaction.
We also encourage students to develop the appropriate skills and understanding
that will enable them to use these resources well and safely, as well as
the ability to analyse and evaluate the resources they find. These new
media literacy skills will be fundamental in the society our students will
be entering.</p>
<p>Children using the school’s computing facilities will be expected to comply
with the following rules. Failure to abide by the rules may result in a
temporary or permanent ban on the student’s use of the facilities.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> play games during lessons only if instructed by
my teacher for teaching and learning purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will </strong>surf the Internet during lessons only under my
teacher’s guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> keep my password a secret and will not share it
with anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will not </strong>share my personal information (e.g., address,
phone number, pictures) with anyone online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> obey the terms of use for social media platforms
(e.g. WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok require users to be at least 13 years
old) and will not create accounts if I am underaged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> check the reliability and accuracy of the information
I access online and recognise that some websites may contain incorrect
or misleading content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> only download, copy, or share videos, music, pictures,
or other people’s work with their permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> immediately report any online encounters with strangers
to a trusted adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will</strong> stay respectful and will not harm, bully, or say
unkind words to others online or offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will </strong>only take or post pictures or videos of others
with their permission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school has built and maintained this website on the world wide web
and pages on various social media platforms. Students whose work or images
appear on these platforms will be identified only by their first names.
Should any parent or guardian particularly wish their child’s / ward’s
name or photograph not to appear on these platforms or school publications,
they may email the school principal to make that request.</p>
