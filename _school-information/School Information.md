<p><strong>Principal's Address</strong> 
<br>As we look back on our meaningful 50th Anniversary celebrations in November
2025, I am reminded of what truly defines CPS — our people. Our teachers
have immense heart. They pour themselves into their work, often far beyond
what is required, because they believe deeply in nurturing every child.
Their dedication is the backbone of our students’ holistic growth.</p>
<p>Equally important are our parents. When home and school stand together,
our children flourish. Your partnership in values, communication, and shared
responsibility helps our students grow into confident, kind, and resilient
young learners. Thank you, parents, for walking this journey with us.</p>
<p>We are also strengthened by our community partners, from SPF and SCDF
to St. Joseph’s Home, All-Saints Home, and many others. Their support brings
authentic, intergenerational learning to our students and reminds us that
CPS is part of a larger, caring ecosystem. Our alumni, too, continue to
inspire the next generation.</p>
<p>All the significant adults, teachers, parents, partners, and alumni, form
the fabric of CPS. There is no textbook that can fully prepare our children
for the future; it is the real interactions, lived experiences, and values
they receive from all of us that shape their character and confidence.</p>
<p>As we step into 2026, may our partnership remain strong, our community
vibrant, and our collective purpose unwavering. Together, we will continue
giving our students the rich experiences they need to learn, grow, and
shine.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce new staff
additions to our CPS family and thank the staff who have left us. They
bring with them varied leadership and teaching experiences that will strengthen
the school’s capabilities to provide a holistic education for our Corporation
STARS.</p>
