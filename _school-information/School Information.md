<p><strong>Principal's Address</strong> 
<br>A warm welcome to 2025! As we embark on another exciting chapter at Corporation
Primary School, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the wonderful
journey we shared in 2024. This past year, our students demonstrated remarkable
growth, resilience, and curiosity in their learning journeys. These qualities,
nurtured by our dedicated teachers and parents’ invaluable support, have
set the foundation for their success as lifelong learners.</p>
<p>In 2025, we are excited to deepen our commitment to fostering Lifelong
Learning (LfL) in every child. At Corporation Primary School, LfL is more
than a goal—it is a mindset and way of life. This year, we will continue
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Develop a Growth Mindset </strong>in our students, helping them
see challenges as opportunities and setbacks as stepping stones to success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build 21st Century Competencies</strong> such as adaptability and
communication, ensuring our students are well-prepared for a rapidly evolving
world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deepen Learning</strong> through inquiry-based approaches and hands-on
experiences that connect classroom knowledge to real-world applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broaden and Enrich Experiences</strong> by encouraging participation
in co-curricular activities, community projects, and opportunities for
global exposure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This year is especially significant as we celebrate our <strong>50th Anniversary</strong>.
This milestone is a testament to the enduring legacy of excellence, community,
and growth that we have built together since 1975. We look forward to commemorating
this golden jubilee with meaningful events that bring together our students,
parents, staff, and alumni.</p>
<p>As we move forward, let us continue to inspire our children to thrive
with resilience, curiosity, and confidence. Together, as a school community,
we can shape a future filled with hope, opportunity, and promise for every
child.</p>
<p>Thank you for your unwavering partnership and trust. Here’s to a year
of celebration, growth, and shared achievements!</p>
<p>On that note I would also like to welcome the following teachers to the
CPS family.</p>
