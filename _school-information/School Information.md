<p><strong>Principal's Address</strong> 
<br>As we usher in the new year, it is an opportune time to also reflect on
what has happened in 2023. Last year was our first full year without major
Covid-19 restrictions. Learning Journeys, Fiestas, Camps, Sports Carnival,
and many other learning experiences resumed full-scale, to the benefit
of our students. These experiences were invaluable and provided students
with meaningful opportunities to deepen and broaden their learning.</p>
<p>Before we ended Term 4 last year, I challenged the students to learn one
new skill during the December holidays. It can be something that they have
always wanted to learn but could not, for whatever reason. We want to encourage
a culture of lifelong learning and for our students to explore their passion.
The goal is not so much of the outcome (newly learnt skill) but more importantly,
the process that the students must go through to achieve their outcome.
We want to encourage self-directedness, ownership and joy in learning that
goes beyond the four walls of the classroom.</p>
<p>Teachers play an integral role in developing our students holistically.
They are not just knowledge disseminators or subject-content providers.
They are facilitators of learning and character-builders. Every student
is unique and teachers in CPS strive to maximise students’ potential by
developing their talents and strengths. Moving forward, the school will
continue to provide varied learning experiences that will help build character
and develop talents in our students.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce new staff
additions to our CPS family. They bring with them varied leadership and
teaching experiences that will strengthen the school’s capabilities to
provide a holistic education for our Corporation STARS.</p>
