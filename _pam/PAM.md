PAM
===

**Vision**:   

The PAM department aims to holistically nurture our students through their senses to A.C.E (Appreciate. Create. Enjoy) the arts and lead a healthy and active lifestyle.  
  

**Introduction of PAM Vision**

Physical education, Art and Music (PAM) subjects are important components of a child’s development which focus on enhancing the various sensory development of our students and these developments have a positive impact on a child’s learning journey. Since 2009, PERI (Primary Education Review and Implementation) committee was created to review teaching and learning in the   

lower primary levels. This new initiative created a direct impact on how PAM subjects are taught in Singapore.     

  

**Mission**: To create a vibrant environment to inculcate aesthetic literacy and passion for the arts

While students continue to be equipped with skills and knowledge, the PAM lessons are designed to develop critical and inventive thinking through collaborative work which are essential skills that our students need to be equipped with in this 21st century. PAM lessons are also great platforms to instil character building. Our lessons are therefore specially designed to ingrain our school values (RICHER) as an effort towards the holistic development of a child.
