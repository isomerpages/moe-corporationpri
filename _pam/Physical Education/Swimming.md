Swimming
========
Swimming develops students’ confidence to maneuver their bodies with control while experiencing the sensation of water balance, buoyancy and propulsion, in order to facilitate floating and moving in, under, and on water.

  

CPS students will go through the swim-safer programme at Primary 3. We believe that starting water play activities that emphasizes enjoyment during initial learning will enhance students’ water movement competence, without losing focus on water safety.
