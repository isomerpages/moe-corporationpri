Games and Sports
================
Games and Sports promote the students’ playful tendency to control objects and the body during the early stages of learning.

A range of game play experiences from territorial-invasion, net-barrier, striking-fielding, and other games encourages students’ safe and maximal participation, with modification to game rules to match and enhance their developing skills and understanding.

PE teachers will apply the ‘Games Concept Approach’  to teach games-related concepts such as ‘using space’, ‘keeping possession’, ‘creating attack’, ‘delaying invasion’, ‘defending space’, ‘advancing bases’ to help students develop the cognitive understanding towards making appropriate decision in game like situations. The structure of these lessons also provide the platform for our students to learn and demonstrate values like integrity, respect and resilience.
