Gymnastics
==========

Gymnastics enhances overall body management and control through creative interpretation of movement and sequence.

  

The emphasis is on challenging students, working either alone or in pairs and groups, to maneuver their bodies safely on the floor and when negotiating a variety of apparatus.

  

Our gymnastic lessons work hand in hand with the dance curriculum to enable students to  identify similarities in both learning areas. The challenge to creatively design gymnastic sequence with their peers provide the platform to hone students’ critical and creative thinking skills and attitudes such as care, harmony, responsibility and resilience.
