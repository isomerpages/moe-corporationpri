Physical Health and Fitness
===========================
Students will acquire an understanding of a range of good health practices and habits in personal care and hygiene such as vision, oral and auditory care and keeping safe against illnesses and diseases. 

  

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach is used to help students make meaningful connections between health concepts and practical applications through a multitude of customized learning tasks.  

  

This learning area also exposes students to develop good practices in safety, which includes areas such as road, fire and water safety.
