**PE Vision in CPS**: We seek to enable students to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.  

  

In 2014, a new 2014 PE syllabus was introduced using Learning Outcomes (LOs) to specify minimally what students should know and be able to do as a result of their learning.&nbsp;  

  

The Primary PE syllabus aims to develop competent movers who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies.

In Corporation primary school, our PE curriculum is designed in a spiral approach.&nbsp;
This approach seeks to reinforce the&nbsp;skills and knowledge taught within the learning year and across their six years in school.&nbsp;We believe that this approach provides a holistic learning experience for our students.&nbsp;

  

Students are excited and confident to pick up new skills and knowledge, apply them during authentic situations and facilitate the development of character as they are provided with the platform to practise 21st century competencies in our PE lessons.
