Dance
=====
Dance develops in students an understanding of rhythmic movement.  It also enables students to express and communicate feelings and ideas through exploration, creation and performance.  

  

In learning to move through dance, students will progress through the following developmental sequence incorporating an understanding of body, space, effort and relationship awareness.

In line with the school's Life-long Learning Programme (LLP), more opportunities for involvement in and enjoyment of different dances can promote harmony and respect for cultural differences as they express their passion for dance through school events like CPS got Talent and P6 Graduation Concert.
